We also discussed the retirement and decommissioning of old biofouling-encrusted oil and gas platforms (similar to 62 platforms) from decreased production and the current oil crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This presents an ecological concern due invasive coral range expansion and potential impacts to poorly studied ecosystems such as marginal shallow-water coral reefs and mesophotic ecosystems.

We found that oil and gas platforms off the coast of California have the highest secondary fish production per unit area of seafloor of any marine habitat that has been studied, about an order of magnitude higher than fish communities from other marine ecosystems. Most previous estimates have come from estuarine environments, generally regarded as one of the most productive ecosystems globally. High rates of fish production on these platforms ultimately result from high levels of recruitment and the subsequent growth of primarily rockfish (genus Sebastes) larvae and pelagic juveniles to the substantial amount of complex hardscape habitat created by the platform structure distributed throughout the water column. The platforms have a high ratio of structural surface area to seafloor surface area, resulting in large amounts of habitat for juvenile and adult demersal fishes over a relatively small footprint of seafloor.

The decision to remove such structures or turn them into reefs (i.e. 'rigs-to-reefs') hinges on the habitat value they provide, yet this can rarely be determined because the residency of mobile species is difficult to establish. Here, we test a novel solution to this problem for reef fishes; the use of otolith (earstone) properties to identify oil structures of residence. We compare the otolith microchemistry and otolith shape of a site-attached coral reef fish (Pseudanthias rubrizonatus) among four oil structures (depth 82-135 m, separated by 9.7-84.2 km) on Australia's North West Shelf to determine if populations developed distinct otolith properties during their residency. Microchemical signatures obtained from the otolith edge using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) differed among oil structures, driven by elements Sr, Ba and Mn, and to a lesser extent Mg and Fe. A combination of microchemical data from the otolith edge and elliptical Fourier (shape) descriptors allowed allocation of individuals to their 'home' structure with moderate accuracy (overall allocation accuracy: 63.3%, range: 45.5-78.1%), despite lower allocation accuracies for each otolith property in isolation (microchemistry: 47.5%, otolith shape: 45%). Site-specific microchemical signatures were also stable enough through time to distinguish populations during 3 separate time periods, suggesting that residence histories could be recreated by targeting previous growth zones in the otolith. Our results indicate that reef fish can develop unique otolith properties during their residency on oil structures which may be useful for assessing the habitat value of individual structures. The approach outlined here may also be useful for determining the residency of reef fish on artificial reefs, which would assist productivity assessments of these habitats. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The unique architecture of each platform may influence the size and structure of the associated fish assemblage if different structural elements form distinct habitats for fishes. Using scuba survey data from 11 southern California platforms from 1995 to 2000, we examined fish assemblages associated with structural elements of the structure, including the major horizontal crossbeams outside of the jacket, vertical jacket legs, and horizontal crossbeams that span the jacket interior. Patterns of habitat association were examined among three depth zones: shallow (<16.8 m), midwater (16.8-26 m), and deep (>26 m); and between two life stages: youngof-the-year and non-young-of-the-year. Fish densities tended to be greatest along horizontal beams spanning the jacket interior, relative to either horizontal or vertical beams along the jacket exterior, indicating that the position of the habitat within the overall structure is an important characteristic affecting fish habitat use. Fish densities were also higher in transects centered directly over a vertical or horizontal beam relative to transects that did not contain a structural element.

To address concerns of bias in using video footage from industry structural surveys for biological assessments, we compared estimates of invertebrate density and species richness beneath a California oil platform determined using data from three sources: video from an in-dustry ROV structural survey, video from a scientific ROV biological survey using the same vehicle, and photoquadrat still imagery from a scientific scuba diver survey. All surveys were conducted along the same jacket crossbeams. We found that the epibenthic assemblages characterized by the two ROV methods were similar. More species were observed in the diver photoquadrats than in either of the two kinds of ROV surveys, because smaller and more cryptic species could be resolved.

There is evidence that the artificial habitat supplied by platforms in the Gulf of Mexico has increased the regional carrying capacity for economically important reef fish species such as red snapper. Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are customary destinations for both commercial and recreational fishing and Rigs-to-Reefs programs of Gulf States are actively expanding each year. Contrary to the Gulf of Mexico experience, California platforms are concentrated in the Santa Barbara Channel area among natural reefs and offshore islands and they harbor fish assemblages that resemble those found in nearby habitats. Observations at natural reefs and platforms off California found that platforms have become refugia for increasingly rare and overfished species, which is thought to be, in part, a result of light to nonexistent fishing pressure at those platforms.

It is important, therefore, that the selected sample is sufficiently representative of the population to draw generalized conclusions. Here, a formal clustering methodology, partitioning around medoids, was used to produce a typology of surface-piercing oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. The variables used for clustering were hydrocarbon product, operational state, platform design and material, and substructure weight. Assessing intra-cluster variability identified 13 clusters as the optimum number. The most important distinguishing variable was platform type, isolating floating platforms first, then concrete gravity-based and then fixed steel. Following clustering, a geographic trend was evident, with oil production more prevalent in the north and gas in the south.

In this study, we review shell mound research relevant to decommissioning, including mound formation, contaminant loads, associated biological communities, and transitions following the removal of platform structures at four sites. To address the gap in knowledge of shell mound fish community structure, we used manned submersible and remotely operated vehicle surveys from 1997 to 2013 to estimate the biomass, density, species composition and similarity between shell mounds at 22 southern California platforms.

The 108 day-night samples collected alongside (vertical tows) and nearby (surface and oblique tows) platforms yielded 1526 larval and early juvenile fishes representing 55 taxa from 45 families. Epipelagic/mesopelagic taxa dominated the catches, whereas hard/soft habitat-associated taxa were uncommon. Carangidae (36.2%) and Myctophidae (31.5%) dominated in summer and winter, respectively. The most abundant taxon was Trachurus declivis (Carangidae, 35.1%), followed by Bovichtus angustifrons (Bovichtidae, 8.7%), Scomberesox saurus (Scomberesocidae. 3.7%), Centroberyx affinis (Berycidae, 3.0%) and Arripis trutta (Arripidae, 1.7%). Fish concentrations (nos. per 100 in 3) alongside platforms did not differ significantly between day and night across all surveys. Likewise, concentrations nearby platforms in February 1999, including those of T. declivis, did not vary significantly by tow type (surface vs. oblique) or day vs. night. The far greater diversity and abundance recorded in February 1999 are likely the result of upwelling conditions over the eastern Bass Strait shelf during the sampling period, and which were not detected in February 1998. In the absence of data on adult fishes associated with the Bass Strait platforms, and given the limited availability of reefs directly around the area, it could be argued that some of the taxa caught may originate from spawning around neighboring natural reefs, particularly those off the Gippsland coastline and the south-east corner of mainland Australia. However, the prime position of the platforms almost right in the center of a productivity hotspot would have a confounding effect on the potential source(s) of larval fishes in that region of south-eastern Australia. The role of platforms as potential de-facto reefs for juvenile fishes in Bass Strait, as well as spawning areas, is discussed based on the findings of this study, the first on early stages of fishes around oil and gas platforms in Australia.

Today, over 3,837 offshore oil and gas platforms have been installed, producing 25% of the U.S.A.'s natural gas and approximately 13% of its oil. In addition to meeting the world's energy needs, these structures also form one of the world's most extensive de facto artificial reef systems. However, federal regulations require that these structures be removed within 1 yr after the mineral lease is terminated. Disposal of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures is not only a financial liability for private industry, but can also result in a loss of productive marine habitat. In 1986, the Louisiana Fishing Enhancement Act was signed into law in response to the National Fishing Enhancement Act, creating the Louisiana Artificial Reef Program. This program was designed to take advantage of fishing habitat opportunities offered by these obsolete platforms. Since the program's inception, 25 reef sites have been created off Louisiana's coast using the components (jackets and decks) of 71 obsolete platforms. The use of obsolete oil and gas platforms in Louisiana has proved to be highly successful. Their quantity, design, longevity, and stability have provided a number of advantages over the use of traditional artificial reef materials. Participating companies also save money by converting structures into reefs rather than abandoning them onshore. They then are required to donate a portion of the savings to the state to run the artificial reef program. One disadvantage, however, is that the large size of these platforms restricts the distance from shore where they can be placed. To achieve the minimum clearance of 16 m over a submerged structure, as required by the New Orleans (8th) Coast Guard District regulations, the platforms must be placed in waters deeper than 30 m. Waters of this depth are found between 22 km and 115 km from shore on Louisiana's gently sloping continental shelf, making them almost inaccessible to many anglers. Funds generated by the program, however, can be used to develop reefs to closer to shore if alternative low-profile materials are used. Due to the high maintenance costs of both the structure and aids to navigation, the increased liability exposure, and the undetermined cost of removing the structure once it becomes a hazard to public safety and navigation, leaving the structures standing in place has thus far proved not to be a viable option in Louisiana.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Rouse, Sally; Hayes, Peter; Wilding, Thomas A.",Commercial fisheries losses arising from interactions with offshore pipelines and other oil and gas infrastructure and activities,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,77,3,1148,1156,10.1093/icesjms/fsy116,MAY-JUN 2020,2020,"Interactions between fishing vessels and oil and gas infrastructure can result in damage to fishing gear, loss of fishing time/access, and risks to crew health and safety.

If significant contamination is occurring, it would be expected to impair the reproductive abilities of impacted fishes. One form of reproductive impairment is atresia, the abnormal reabsorption of oocytes that are destined to be spawned. Atresia has been widely used as an indicator of pollutant-related reproductive impairment in fishes. We examined the occurrence of atretic oocytes in Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus, collected near two offshore platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel (B and Gilda) and from two natural reference sites (off the east end of Santa Cruz Island and in mid-channel off Rincon).

Major exceptions to this are coral reefs of the Flower Garden Banks (FGB), similar to200 km S-SE of Galveston, Texas, USA. We determined whether extensive scleractinian coral populations had colonized these platforms, quantified them, and determined their population and community characteristics. We also examined the relationship between these variables and distance from the FGB, platform age and depth. Surveys were performed on 13 oil or gas production platforms down to 36 m depth, encompassing an ellipse around the FGB. Corals occurred in abundance on most of the platforms. We found 11 species, comprising 8 hermatypic scleractinians, 2 ahermatypic scleractinians and 1 hydrozoan coral. The most abundant corals were Madracis decactis, Diploria strigosa and Tubastraea coccinea. Distance from the FGB was not related to the coral community variables measured, including total coral abundances of the dominant 3 species in shallow water (<14 m), deep water (14 to 36 m), or both depths combined. Total coral abundance increased significantly with increasing platform age, and the community was best developed on platforms >12 to 15 yr old. Abundance of M. decactis increased significantly with increasing platform age in deeper water and both depths combined, as did coral species diversity (S). This was not the case with D. strigosa, indicating that it may not be associated with any particular successional sere. Neither was T coccinea abundance associated with platform age, except in shallow water, where it decreased in abundance with increasing age, indicating that this species may be an opportunistic pioneer species.

We compared adult densities and potential larval production of these species at platforms and natural outcrops in California. Densities of mature bocaccio and cowcod were highly variable among survey sites, but were generally very low at both natural reefs and platforms. However, the mean densities for both species were higher around platforms than at natural reefs. Two of the three platforms (Gail and Hidalgo) that harbored mature bocaccio had larger mature individuals than did any natural reef. Platform Gail had by far the highest densities of both mature bocaccio and cowcod of any natural or human-made habitat and the potential larval production of both species at Platform Gail was much higher than at any other site surveyed.

These structures have been shown to be important habitats for both settlement and growth for reef fishes. Important information on the biological effects (i.e., loss of biomass and production) of different decommissioning options has not yet been explored in detail. An important step in the assessment of these different decommissioning options is to look at the potential loss of fish production and habitat under the different alternatives. Using the large amount of information available on fish abundances at these structures, we have created a model to estimate the standing stock of fishes and production that would be lost because of both partial (removal from surface to 85 ft) and complete removal (the 2 decommissioning options being considered). Complete removal of a platform will likely eliminate most of its fish biomass; however, this study has shown that for rockfishes, which settle predominantly below 85 feet (26 m) and move deeper as they age, partial removal through topping would leave more than 90% of the fish biomass at the deeper platforms. Modeling of larval dispersal suggests that platforms provide an important opportunity for recruitment of fish larvae and that many larvae produced near the platforms would settle elsewhere in the region.

Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the role of O&G infrastructure in maintaining, altering or enhancing ecological connectivity with natural marine habitats. There is a paucity of studies on the subject with only 33 papers specifically targeting connectivity and O&G structures, although other studies provide important related information. Evidence for O&G structures facilitating vertical and horizontal seascape connectivity exists for larvae and mobile adult invertebrates, fish and megafauna; including threatened and commercially important species.

We discuss the potential impacts of different decommissioning approaches on seascape connectivity and identify, through expert elicitation, critical knowledge gaps that, if addressed, may further inform decision making for the life cycle of O&G infrastructure, with relevance for other industries (e.g. renewables). The most highly ranked critical knowledge gap was a need to understand how O&G structures modify and influence the movement patterns of mobile species and dispersal stages of sessile marine species. Understanding how different decommissioning options affect species survival and movement was also highly ranked, as was understanding the extent to which O&G structures contribute to extending species distributions by providing rest stops, foraging habitat, and stepping stones.

Laws require that a platform at the end of its production life be totally removed unless the submerged jacket section continues as a reef under state sponsorship. Consideration of the eventual fate of the populations of fishes and invertebrates beneath platforms has led to global reefing of the jacket portion of platforms instead of removal at the time of decommissioning. The construction and use of artificial reefs are centuries old and global in nature using a great variety of materials. The history that led to the reefing option for platforms begins in the mid-20th century in an effort for general artificial reefs to provide both fishing opportunities and increase fisheries production for a burgeoning U.S. population. The trend toward reefing platforms at end of their lives followed after the oil and gas industry installed thousands of standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico where they had become popular fishing destinations.

With the upcoming era of decommissioning of oil and gas structures, it is timely to assess the usefulness of this footage for researching these communities. We used ROV inspection footage to characterize the sessile invertebrates and fishes associated with the Goodwyn Alpha Production Platform (GWA) on the North West Shelf of Australia between depths of 10 and 125 m during 2006 and 2008. Depth was a major driver of invertebrate assemblages, most likely due to specific requirements such as light, and differences between years were most likely from the physical detachment of species by cyclones and internal waves. Phototrophic species were mostly limited to the upper 50 m of the platform, including the hard coral Pociiopora sp. and the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Scleronephthya sp. In contrast, heterotrophic species including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, hydroids, bivalves such as Lopha folium and the hard coral Tubastrea spp., were distributed across all depths. We observed 1791 fish from at least 10 families and 19 species, including commercial species such as crimson seaperch (Lutjanus erythropterus), red emperor (L. sebae), saddle-tailed seaperch (L. malabaricus), mangrove jack (L. argentimaculatus) and trevally (Caranx spp.). Fish density increased significantly with depth during 2008, from a mean of 23 fish/50 m(2) between 10 and 25 m to 3373 fish/50 m(2) at 125 m, where small unidentified baitfish were abundant. The highest densities of commercial species occurred between 25 and 75 m depth, suggesting that mid-depth platform sections had high habitat value, a consideration when selecting decommissioning options. The greatest difficulties using the video were the poor lighting and resolution that inhibited our ability to identify sessile species with high taxonomic precision. However, the footage was useful for evaluating high-level biodiversity of the platform, understanding how fish and invertebrate communities changed with depth and comprehending the dynamic nature of the invertebrate community over time.

Less well understood is the response of porpoises to sounds emitted from oil and gas (O&G) platforms during routine operations. The responses are not easily predicted as platforms can act simultaneously and to varying degree as a source of disturbance through noise and attraction through an artificial reef effect with increased prey abundance and diversity. To investigate the presence and feeding behaviour of harbour porpoises around platforms, autonomous acoustic loggers were placed for up to 2 years, at 21 stations 0-25.6 km from the largest platform in the Danish North Sea. Harbour porpoises were detected at all distances year round in two distinct seasonal activity patterns. During July-January, porpoises were attracted to the platform as indicated by high foraging activity within 800 m of the platform. Echolocation activity levels were up to twofold higher than those observed at 3.2-9.6 km from the platform. Similar high echolocation activity was observed 200 m from neighbouring offshore installations located within 15 km, regardless of their size, during May-July. This study shows that porpoises may be attracted to offshore O&G platforms despite confirmed elevated underwater noise and are likely exploiting higher prey abundance in the vicinity of such structures. This is possibly due to increased prey availability created by the combined effect of the artificial reef formed by the underwater structure and the local protected area around all platforms where fishery is banned.

Therefore, it is critical to understand the habitat value of O&G infrastructure to marine life in the Bass Strait and whether decommissioning of these structures affect local marine ecosystems and fisheries. We analyzed industry-collected remotely operated vehicle (ROV) imagery from 2008-2018 and compared this data with reported catch data from fishing vessels operating in this region collected by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) from 2008-2018. We assessed species richness and relative abundance on two platforms and two pipelines and compared the species composition with retained catch reported by commercial fishers operating in Commonwealth fisheries. We found diverse communities of fishes and invertebrates around O&G structures, with a different subset of species inhabiting pipelines than platforms. We found little overlap between the species that were targeted by commercial fishers and those found around O&G structures (10% overlap), however, species composition data from fisheries often groups species making the data coarse and under-representative of true species diversity.

Using a three-dimensional biophysical model, we quantified the potential connectivity of larvae, particularly relevant to reef fishes, from three offshore platforms to four coastal shelf regions where the majority of rocky settlement habitat occurs in the SCB. The regions cover the shelves of the mainland coast and islands and offshore banks in the southern SCB. The main findings indicate that (1) the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the southern SCB to populations in the northern SCB are greater than the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the northern SCB to the southern SCB; (2) there is greater seasonal variability of potential connectivity from platforms to the mainland shelf region of the northern SCB than to the mainland shelf region of the southern SCB or shelves around islands and banks; and (3) there is consistency across years in the relative magnitude of potential connectivity from the platforms to the four shelf regions.

In this work, underwater visual census techniques were applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages associated with extractive platforms. Data were collected during three seasons according to the following spatial factors: Location (Adriatic and Ionian Seas), Depth (0-6 m and 12-18 m) and Distance from the platform (external and internal). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed highly significant differences for each factor assessed in this study, as well as for the interaction among said factors. Results indicated that artificial structures in both the Adriatic and Ionian Seas act as artificial reefs attracting reef-dwelling or partially reef-dwelling species, which are not present far from the platforms in open waters. Results also showed significant differences between Ionian and Adriatic fish assemblages, with a higher mean density of fish and a greater mean number of species in the latter basin. Boops boops, Chromis chromis and several species belonging to the Blennidae family most contributed to these differences. This is likely due to the eutrophication that involves the coast of the northern and central Adriatic, allowing a high production of fish, especially planctivorous. Thanks to the eutrophication, platforms located in this basin are characterized by a greater abundance of fouling organisms which offer a perfect habitat for cryptobenthic species, such as Blennids. Moreover, Thalassoma pavo and Scorpaena maderensis, thermophilic species, were more abundant in the Ionian platforms than in the Adriatic ones thus contributing to the dissimilarities between these two basins. Present results could bear strong implications for the environmental management of drilling and production activities in different basins. Assessing biodiversity in these highly complex contexts is a challenge for the near future, and the existence of a reliable method such as UVC would affect international research in this field.

Artificial hard substrate, such as that associated with oil and gas platforms, provides settlement opportunities for species adapted to hard substrates in areas of soft sediment. The contribution of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine connectivity is not clear, yet such information is vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources. This study demonstrates the application of a social network analysis approach to quantify and describe the ecological connectivity, informed by particle tracking model outputs, of hard substrate marine communities in the North Sea. Through comparison of networks with and without artificial hard substrate, and based on hypothetical decommissioning scenarios, this study provides insight into the contribution of artificial hard substrate, and the consequence of decommissioning, to the structure and function of marine community connectivity. This study highlights that artificial hard substrate, despite providing only a small proportion of the total area of hard substrate, increases the geographic extent and connectivity of the hard substrate network, bridging gaps, thereby providing 'stepping stones' between otherwise disconnected areas of natural hard substrate. Compared to the baseline scenario, a decommissioning scenario with full removal of oil and gas platforms results in a nearly 60% reduction in connectivity. Such reduction in connectivity may have negative implications for species' distribution, gene flow and resilience following disturbance or exploitation of marine hard substrate communities.

There are few records of this disease in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, a region characterized by soft muddy bottoms that are considered poor habitat for the CTX source dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. However, the approximately 4000 petroleum production platforms and hundreds of state-sponsored artificial reefs located in the Gulf of Mexico provide hard substrate and often support coral and other components of the tropical benthos. In addition to their role in their resource extraction, these oil production platforms are also popular sites for recreational fishing and sport diving. We examined these platforms as potential substrate for G. toxicus and report a first record of this species in the NW Gulf of Mexico. All the platforms (n = 6) examined harbored the dinoflagellate as an epiphyte on the fouling community, with three finds of G. toxicus associated with the pelagic macroalga, Sargassum. Only minor toxicity (< 0.15 ppb) was noted in two of 20 great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) examined. Tagging data suggest trans-Gulf migrations by barracuda are common; thus, we cannot determine if the toxicity was acquired locally or transported in migrating fish.These platforms are a clear example of how human activity has altered the environment in a way that allows expansion of a HA-B population. The rapid increase in production platforms since 1942 has provided novel substrate in a sandy/muddy bottom environment generally considered to be poor habitat for these benthic dinoflagellates. These platforms create a unique habitat in the upper euphotic zone and serve as intersection points for fishermen and potentially toxic fish. Many Gulf of Mexico states have active programs to turn non-producing platforms into artificial reefs. Our results suggest that the use of these platforms as fisheries enhancement structures could have unintended consequences for human health, particularly if projected rising sea-surface temperatures over the next century alter benthic distributions and fish migration patterns. These concerns also extend to mariculture operations around oil production rigs or offshore wind farms, both of which would also add substrate for epibenthic microalgae. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Both local marine ecology and political climate play a role in decommissioning offshore oil production platforms. Compared to the relatively supportive political climate in the Gulf of Mexico for rigs-to-reefs programs, conflicting social values among stakeholders in Southern California increases the need for understanding ecological impacts of various decommissioning alternatives (which range from total removal to allowing some or all of platform structure to remain in the ocean). Additional scientific needs in the decommissioning process include further assessment of platform habitat quality, estimation of regional impacts of decommissioning alternatives to marine populations, and determination of biological effects of any residual contaminants. The principal management need is a ranking of environmental priorities (e.g. species-of-interest and marine habitats). Because considerable numbers of economically important species reside near oil platforms, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries should consider the consequences of decommissioning alternatives in their overall management plans. Management strategies could include designating reefed platforms as marine protected areas.

As platforms reach the end of their useful lifetime, operators and regulatory agencies will assess the environmental impact of potential decommissioning strategies. Among the many factors that will be weighed in preparation for these major economic and engineering challenges is the fate of the fish and invertebrate communities that inhabit the structures underwater. Offshore platforms act as inadvertent artificial reefs, and some are recognized among the most productive fish habitats in the global oceans. We present a model for forecasting changes to fish communities surrounding offshore installations following a series of decommissioning alternatives. Using 24 platforms off southern California, we estimate fish biomass and somatic production under three possible decommissioning scenarios: leave in place, partial removal at 26-m depth, and complete removal of the platform and underlying shell mound. We used fish density and size data from scuba and submersible surveys of the platforms from 1995-2013 to estimate biomass and annual somatic production. Bottom trawl surveys were used to characterize future fish assemblages at platform sites under the complete-removal decommissioning scenario. Based on a conservatively modeled extrapolation of the survey data, we found that complete removal of a platform resulted in 95% or more reduction in the average fish biomass and annual somatic production at the site, while partial removal resulted in far smaller losses, averaging 10% or less. In the event that all surveyed platforms are completely removed, we estimated a total loss of more than 28,000 kg of fish biomass in the Southern California Bight. Platform habitats, which attract reef-dwelling fish species, had minimal overlap in community composition with the surrounding soft-bottom habitat.

Designed artificial reef systems are similar, albeit smaller, modified habitats designed to accommodate fish assemblages. We compared fish production at a large designed reef to reported production at oil platforms. Given the focus in artificial reef research on distinguishing between new and aggregated fish production, we used a different approach to that of Claisse et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 15462-15467, 2014) to calculate production, based on a steady-state assumption. This assumption simplifies the analysis and distinguishes 'local production', 'new production', and 'biomass flux'. Comparing biomass flux with standing stock biomass enables a new approach to address the production versus attraction debate, by revealing how much biomass is exposed to fishing compared to how much has local production. The local fish production at this artificial reef was 384 g m(-2) year(-1), which is within the 105887 g m(-2) year(-1) range reported by Claisse et al., although our study included visitor species not included by Claisse et al. We estimate that the fish production new to the ecosystem may only be 4-5 % of the local production, due to the large abundance of visitor species on this reef. The annual flux of biomass across this reef was very large, similar to 380 times greater than the standing stock biomass, meaning that this reef is vulnerable to overexploitation from fishing.

This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80% of fish biomass and 86% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Shell mounds are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.",Yes,Ray,No,Yes,Ray,NA,fish biomass /space /year,NA,,,J,"Streich, Matthew K.; Ajemian, Matthew J.; Wetz, Jennifer J.; Stunz, Gregory W.",A Comparison of Fish Community Structure at Mesophotic Artificial Reefs and Natural Banks in the Western Gulf of Mexico,MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES,9,1,170,189,10.1080/19425120.2017.1282897,2017,2017,"Oil and gas platforms along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf have served as artificial reefs since oil and gas exploration intensified in the 1950s. As these structures are decommissioned, they must be removed; however, some are converted to permanent artificial reefs. Despite the potential effects these artificial habitats may have on marine fisheries, investigations that assess the fish communities inhabiting these structures relative to natural habitats are rare. During fall 2012, we used remotely operated vehicle surveys to compare fish communities between artificial reefs (i.e., reefed platforms; n = 5) and adjacent natural banks (n = 5) in the western GOM. Our surveys successfully documented 79 species representing 28 families. Multivariate analyses suggested that fish communities at artificial reefs were distinct from those at natural banks. Post hoc analyses indicated that the differences were driven by high abundances of transient, midwater pelagics and other gregarious species at artificial reefs. Many fisheries species, like the Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, were found in both habitat types, with density at artificial reefs estimated to be nearly eight times greater than at natural banks. Despite lower densities at natural banks, the disproportionately large areas of these habitats resulted in relatively high total abundance estimates-approximately 5% of the 2012 GOM Red Snapper annual catch limit (3.67 million kg [8.08 million lb])-a finding that has significant implications for Red Snapper and artificial reef management in the GOM. Our study suggests that although fish community structure may differ between these two habitats, artificial reefs serve as important habitat for species like Red Snapper by potentially diverting fishing pressure from natural habitats; however, future studies that address species-specific life history traits will be needed to better understand the function and performance of artificial reefs in supporting fisheries productivity.",Yes,Ray,No,NA,Ray,NA,NA,NA,measured fish density (and related metrics),,J,"Martin, Christopher J.

Our surveys of these platforms in 2006 and 2007 indicate that there is a core group of warm- temperate nearshore reef species in the midwater depth (<30 m), including California sheephead Semicossyphus pulcher, blacksmith Chromis punctipinnis, garibaldi Hypsypops rubicundus, opaleye Girella nigricans, and kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus. Platforms located further from shore (i.e., offshore platforms [>14 km]) had a strong seasonal presence of pelagic fishes (primarily jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus) and recruit blacksmiths. At platforms closer to shore (i.e., inshore platforms [<4.8 km]), sea basses (Serranidae) and surfperches (Embiotocidae) were predominant; only slight seasonal variations were observed, which were attributed to prespawning aggregations of barred sand bass Paralabrax nebulifer. At the offshore platforms total fish density had a negative relationship with depth but a positive relationship with water temperature; conversely, total fish biomass exhibited a positive relationship with depth but a negative relationship with temperature. In contrast, at the inshore platforms both total fish density and biomass increased with increasing water temperature. With the exception of blacksmiths, nearshore reef fishes showed significantly greater densities of adults than juveniles. Furthermore, some species were observed spawning at these structures. Therefore, the San Pedro Shelf platforms may provide suitable habitat for several species of nearshore reef fish. Removing the upper levels and superstructure of the offshore platforms to a depth of 25 m (the partial removal decommissioning option) would eliminate critical habitat for several fish species and result in a potential loss of 95% of the total fish density and 77% of the total fish biomass, thus reducing the productivity advantages of some of these structures.",Yes,Ray,No,NA,Ray,NA,NA,NA,measured fish density (and related metrics),,J,"Salcido, RE",Enduring optimism: Examining the rig-to-reef bargain,ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY,32,4,863,937,,2005,2005,"Federal law requires the removal of offshore oil and gas platforms from the seafloor at the end of production.

Eggs, larvae, and post-settlement juveniles typically show high rates of natural mortality. For example, of the 60 million eggs produced annually by a 10-year-old female, only about 450 would survive to 5 cm, the size at which they enter the shrimp fishery. Changes in abundance by size and age appear to be consistent with density dependence in survival rate from ages 0 to 1 and likely ages 0 to 2. Red snapper are attracted to structure or reef habitat at all ages, but larger, older fish also occur over open habitat once they have reached a size that renders them largely invulnerable to predation. Artificial reefs comprise a small fraction of the overall high-relief reef habitat, but harbor a large fraction of the present-day age 2 red snapper populations. Prior to the proliferation of artificial reefs in the northern Gulf, age 2 red snapper may have historically occurred mainly over open-bottom, sand-mud benthic habitat where natural and shrimp trawl bycatch mortality was high. Age 2 fish dominate red snapper populations at artificial reefs, whereas the age composition of red snapper at natural reefs usually show older ages are dominant.

Australian legislation requires oil and gas companies to develop acceptable plans for the safe removal of all offshore infrastructure at the end of a project's life. Over the next 50 years, the liability for this decommissioning in Australia is expected to exceed US$45 billion. Unlike countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, Australian decommissioning activities are in their infancy, with only three cases (to date) in Commonwealth waters where infrastructure has been left in place or partially removed as part of decommissioning. Differences between the Australian marine environment and that of other regions around the world where decommissioning-related research is better progressed include very low sedimentation rates, both tropical and temperate habitats, different species composition, low primary production, and frequent tropical cyclones, as well as unique sociodemographic and cultural characteristics. Accordingly, the outcomes of the decision support tools used in other regions to identify preferred decommissioning options may not be equally applicable in Australia. Here we describe research to support risk and impact assessment for offshore decommissioning in Australia, where full removal of infrastructure is the base case regulatory default, but other options including partial removal and/or repurposing might provide similar or better outcomes when environmental, social, economic and seafood safety aspects are considered.

Although the consumption of macroalgae was indicated for small, mobile consumers including crabs, amphipods, and harpacticoid copepods, both a Bayesian mixing model and temporal changes in isotope composition identified phytoplankton as the most important basal resource for these consumers. Sessile suspension-feeding barnacles and oysters consumed phytoplankton and epiphytes, and probably redirected large amounts of pelagic production to other consumers. Secondary consumers including syllid polychaetes and the blennies, Molly Miller Scartella cristata and Tessellated Blenny Hypsoblennius invemar, exhibited a distinct contribution from epiphytes although large ranges in all potential basal resources were observed. Elemental and isotope analysis of the gut contents of individuals indicated that the nektonic Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus was omnivorous, directly consuming reef-derived macroalgae and epiphytes as well as animal tissue. Although we found that reef-derived resources entered benthic and nektonic food webs surrounding platforms, phytoplankton was the dominant basal resource fueling platform-dwelling communities at the time of our study, and no consumer studied specialized on a diet of red macroalgae.

In this report, the potential for chronic PAH exposure in fish is reported, by measurement of recalcitrant, higher molecular weight PAHs in tissues of fish previously investigated for PAH metabolites in bile. A total of 34 PAHs (20 PAHs, 11 alkylated PAHs, and 3 polycyclic aromatic thiophenes) were targeted. In addition, legacy contaminants-polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),-and current contaminants, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) linked to endocrine disruption, were measured by gas chromatography with electron-capture or mass spectrometric detection, to form a more complete picture of the contaminant-related status of fishes at oil production platforms in the Southern California Bight. No hydrocarbon profiles or unresolved complex hydrocarbon background were found in fish from platforms and from natural areas, and concentrations of aliphatics were low less than 100 nanograms per gram (ng/g) per component). Total-PAH concentrations in fish ranged from 15 to 37 ng/g at natural areas and from 8.7 to 22 ng/g at platforms. Profiles of PAHs were similar at all natural and platform sites, consisting mainly of naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene.

Re-purposing of offshore structures may also be a valid legal option under international maritime law where robust evidence exists to support this option. Given the complex nature of decommissioning offshore infrastructure, a global horizon scan was undertaken, eliciting input from an interdisciplin-ary cohort of 35 global experts to develop the top ten priority research needs to further inform decommissioning de-cisions and advance our understanding of their potential impacts.

A feeding experiment where groups of rainbow trout were fed six diets containing different types of oils for 61 days was performed. The lipid fraction of the six diets was as follows: 1) Fish oil and rapeseed oil (FO diet), 2) Specific structured lipid and rapeseed oil (SL diet), 3) Randomised structured lipids and rapeseed oil (RL diet), 4) Medium chain triglyceride and fish oil (MCT diet), 5) Diacylglycerol and fish oil (DAG diet), 6) Fish oil (FOmax diet). Five of the diets (1-5) contained mixed oils blended to contain the same amount of EPA and DHA. Three of these diets (2,3 and 4) contained medium chain fatty acids incorporated in TAG to be positioned either intentionally as specific (SL), by chance as randomised (RL) or added as medium chain TAG (MCT). Diet 1 contained fish oil (FO) in order to investigate the effect of MCFA and diet 4 contained diacylglycerol (DAG). Diet 6) was a reference diet containing pure fish oil (FOmax). After the feeding period, FO and FOmax fed fish were significantly larger than SL fed fish. Digestibility, measured by adding yttrium oxide as inert marker was significantly lowest for the MCT diet. Fish on the RL and MCT diets had significantly higher protein contents than fish fed FO and FOmax diets. The total fatty acid compositions of the fillet, liver, carcass and viscera were similar and reflected closely that of the diet, also in the sn-2 position. In conclusion, addition of MCT to the diet increased protein content of the fish. There was no additional effect of incorporating the medium chain fatty acids in specific positions and no weight reducing effect of adding DAG to the diets. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Once production ceases, decommissioning options for the platform are assessed. The role that a platform's jacket plays as fish habitat can inform the decommissioning decision. In this study, conducted along the crossbeams of a California platform jacket and using an ROV, we compared estimates of fish diversity and densities determined from a targeted biological survey with those from a replicated structural survey. We found that the water column fish species assemblages characterized by the two methods were similar. By contrast, the two survey methods yielded different species assemblages inhabiting the crossbeam at the platform jacket base. This difference occurred because, at least off California, the platform jacket base species diversity tends to be highest where the bottom crossbeam is undercut, creating sheltering sites for many species. Because the structural method inadequately imaged the seafloor-crossbeam interface, particularly where a gap occurred between crossbeam and seafloor, substantial numbers of fishes were not visible. While we cannot extrapolate from this study to all platforms' worldwide, it is clear that routine platform structural integrity surveys may be a valuable source for opportunistic marine community surveys. Intentional planning of the structural survey to incorporate relatively minor variations (e.g., maintaining fixed ROV distance from the infrastructure and consistent 90 degrees camera angle) coupled with a deliberate consideration of the platform ecology (e.g., positioning the ROV to capture the seafloor-crossbeam interface) can substantially improve the effects on fish assemblage assessments from routine structural surveys without compromising the integrity assessment. We suggest that these biases should be both acknowledged and, understood when using routine structural surveys to inform platform ecology assessment.

Despite the growth of RTR programs worldwide, the functionality of the resulting habitats remains uncertain, particularly due to the lack of comparative studies with natural systems. To address this data gap as it relates to trophic ecology, we compared annual, ontogenetic, and habitat-specific diet and stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) of adult red snapper Lutjanus campechanus (n = 1585) from relic coralgal natural reefs to those of fish from standing and reefed platforms located in similar depth strata of the northwestern GOM. Stomach content analyses revealed significant effects of year, habitat, and total length on prey composition. Subsequent analyses of stable isotope values by size class identified a non-linear relationship with ontogeny. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at reefed platforms and natural reefs decreased in the medium size class (401-600 mm total length), whereas fish from standing platforms exhibited more consistent feeding patterns across ontogeny. Annual variability was also observed in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with 2013 and 2014 significantly different from 2015. These findings suggest that the trophic impacts of habitat type on reef fishes are more complex than previously considered in the GOM and that reefed platforms provide foraging opportunities more similar to natural reefs than standing platforms.",Yes,Ray,No,NA,Ray,NA,NA,NA,Uses stable isotopes and gut content for diet analyses,,J,"King, SC; Johnson, JE; Haasch, ML; Ryan, DAJ; Ahokas, JT; Burns, KA",Summary results from a pilot study conducted around an oil production platform on the Northwest Shelf of Australia,MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,50,11,1163,1172,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.04.027,Nov-05,2005,"The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) conducted a pilot study around the Harriet A oil production platform oil the Northwest Shelf of Australia.

Additionally, the incidence of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria isolated from the liver and bile of all fish captured was examined. Low EROD activity was found in both species, with EROD activity in C fulvoguttatus showing significant site differences. FACs and CYP1A protein levels in C. fulvoguttatus showed a clear trend in hydrocarbon exposure consistent with hydrocarbon chemistry data: Harriet A > Harriet C > reference site.

Although the stock is now showing signs of recovery, management could benefit from a better understanding of regional or even habitat-level differences in stock demographics, as these dynamics ultimately determine overall stock productivity. From 2012 to 2014, we used a fishery-independent vertical line survey to assess Red Snapper relative abundance, size and age structure, and growth parameters at standing oil and gas platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western GOM. We captured 1,170 Red Snapper ranging from 275 to 855 mm TL. Vertical line CPUE data showed no differences among the three habitat types. Ages determined for 1,143 individuals ranged from 2 to 30 years; however, most (90%) were younger than age 8. Size and age frequencies revealed that natural banks supported a greater proportion of large and relatively old fish compared to standing platforms or artificial reefs, although this difference was heavily influenced by a single bank that had significantly larger and older Red Snapper than other sites. Mean age was not significantly different among habitat types. Among a suite of growth models fitted to size-at-age data, the logistic model provided the best fit and suggested that fish from artificial reefs reached larger sizes at age than fish from either standing platforms or natural banks. Our study provides the first estimates of habitat-specific growth parameters for Red Snapper in the western GOM, and this information can benefit future stock assessments.

These steps include: (1) exclusion mapping, (2) establishment of artificial reef planning areas; (3) database compilation; (4) assessment and interpretation of database; (5) mapping of geological and man-made features within each proposed reef site; and (6) site selection.Nautical charts, bathymetric maps, and offshore oil and gas maps were used for exclusion mapping, and to select nine regional planning areas. Pipeline maps were acquired from federal agencies and private industry to determine their general locations within each planning area, and to establish exclusion fairways along each pipeline route.Approximately 1600 line kilometers of high-resolution geophysical data collected by federal agencies and private industry was acquired for the nine planning areas. These data were interpreted to determine the nature and extent of near-surface geologic features that could affect placement of the structures. Seismic reflection patterns were also characterized to evaluate near-bottom sedimentation processes in the vicinity of each reef site. Geotechnical borings were used to determine the lithological and physical properties of the sediment, and for correlation with the geophysical data.Since 1987, five sites containing 10 obsolete production platforms have been selected on the Louisiana OCS using these procedures.

One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills.Methods and principal findings: Samples from natural populations of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea.Conclusion: It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source.

This process must consider impacts to marine ecosystems to meet regulatory requirement and for best environmental practice. However, there is a paucity of information globally on the ecosystem value of these structures, despite the many thousands that are installed throughout our oceans. This study provides the first assessment of fish assemblages and habitats formed by colonising invertebrates on oil and gas wellheads and associated infrastructure in depths of 78-825 m on the north west shelf of Western Australia. Video footage was obtained from Remotely Operated Vehicles deployed by industry on 25 wellhead structures, with six surveyed in each of four distinct depth zones: 78-85 m, 125-135 m, 350-395 m and 490-550 m, and one in 825 m depth. A total of 7278 individual fish from 60 species and 35 families were observed. Commercially important lutjanid (snapper) and epinephelid (grouper) species were common and most abundant on well infrastructure to depths of 135 m, but were absent in depths > 350 m. An as yet unidentified species of roughy, recorded here as Gephyroberyx sp. was the most common fish species observed on well infrastructure in depths > 350 m. Two speckled swellsharks (Cephaloscyllizon speccum), believed to be endemic to north-west Australia, were observed for the first time in situ. Numerous fish species were observed at depths beyond their known limits and two IUCN vulnerable species were recorded: the grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus; 135 m depth) and the round ribbontail ray (Taeniura meyeni; 78 m depth). Fish assemblages and colonising invertebrate habitats present on wellheads and associated infrastructure were strongly influenced by depth, age and height of the structures. Older, taller wellheads in depths < 135 m possessed greater abundances of groupers, snappers, site-attached reef species, and transient pelagic fish species. Beyond 350 m depth, the number of species and total fish abundance declined markedly, as did the percent cover of ascidians, black/octocorals, sponges and Gorgonocephalidae (basket stars) observed growing on the infrastructure. Deeper structures were characterised by an abundance of Gephyroberyx sp. and, while these structures had less colonising invertebrate coverage in general, crinoids (490-550 m) and crustacea (barnacles; 350-395 m) were dominant at these depths. With very little known about marine ecosystems in depths > 100 m, or about wellheads as a type of subsea structure, this study demonstrates the ecological value of ROV footage obtained during industry operations and is indicative of the importance of subsea oil and gas infrastructure as a habitat for fish, and potentially as structures with value to fisheries.",Yes,Ray,No,NA,Ray,NA,NA,NA,measured fish and invert densities and community metrics,,C,"Lee, K; Azetsu-Scott, K; Cobanli, SE; Dalziel, J; Niven, S; Wohlgeschaffen, G; Yeats, R",Overview of potential impacts from produced water discharges in Atlantic Canada,OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS MONITORING: APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES,,,319,342,,2005,2005,"With the development of Canada's offshore oil and gas reserves, large volumes of produced water may be discharged into the ocean.

This issue is especially relevant in light of the high rate of infectious complications and disturbed inflammatory responses in patients receiving this form of nutritional support.Recent findings Studies reporting on novel emulsions based on olive and fish oils, structured lipids or mixed-type emulsions in which various lipid species replace conventional long-chain triglycerides indicate that these lipids are generally well tolerated. While long-chain triglycerides may promote inflammation due to conversion of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids into arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, structured lipids and olive oil emulsions appear more immune-neutral. Leukocyte-activating effects of medium-chain triglycerides in experimental studies await further characterization in vivo. A body of evidence shows that immune modulation by fish oil emulsions is essentially anti-inflammatory in nature. This is in line with the observation that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil replace arachidonic acid in cell membranes as an eicosanoid substrate, resulting in a decreased production of proinflammatory mediators. Importantly, recent investigations indicate beneficial effects of parenteral fish oil on relevant clinical outcome measures.Summary The characteristics of, and mechanisms behind, the effects of various parenteral lipids on immune function are becoming increasingly well understood. The practical relevance of many of these findings is not immediately clear, however, and will have to be substantiated in adequately powered trials before we can translate these findings into a tailored approach for specific clinical situations.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Farmen, E.; Harman, C.; Hylland, K.; Tollefsen, K. -E.",Produced water extracts from North Sea oil production platforms result in cellular oxidative stress in a rainbow trout in vitro bioassay,MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,60,7,1092,1098,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.01.015,Jul-10,2010,"Produced water (PW) discharged from offshore oil industry contains chemicals known to contribute to different mechanisms of toxicity.

The success of the 'rigs to reefs' programme in the Gulf of Mexico has generated some interest in adopting a similar policy on some scale in the North Sea. How this may be achieved following OSPAR 98/3 is reviewed. Studies on the aggregations of fish species have estimated that less than 1.3% of North Sea saithe stocks and less than 0.25% of North Sea cod stocks are associated with oil and gas structures. There is evidence to suggest that fish associated with platforms grow and taste better than off-platform fish, even though very small elevations in hydrocarbon contamination have been detected. Whole ecosystem-based modelling approaches to fishery management indicate that total protection or regeneration of stocks is achieved only through significant area closures to the fishery. The present area closed to the fishery is already maintaining the North Sea fishery status quo. Converting existing structures into offshore reefs is considered unlikely to increase the present area of fishery exclusion nor improve its productivity, even if it was possible under OSPAR 98/3. There has been some speculation of a reef-dominated exclusion zone, whereby the reefs act as a central attractive feature. Bringing the structures inshore for reef construction may have localised positive socio-economic impacts for coastal communities, but achieves no financial benefit for the production industries and does not remove any long-term liability. Without significant levels of state support, both in the fields of construction and liability replacement, a programme of converting rigs into reefs will be difficult to achieve in the context of the North Sea.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Fowler, A.

Calls to relax complete removal requirements in some circumstances and allow part of an O&G installation to be left in the marine environment are increasing. Yet knowledge regarding the biological communities that develop on these structures and their ecological role in the North Sea is currently insufficient to inform such decommissioning decisions. To focus debate regarding decommissioning policy and guide ecological research, we review environmental policy objectives in the region, summarize existing knowledge regarding ecological aspects of decommissioning for both O&G and OWF installations, and identify approaches to address knowledge gaps through science-industry collaboration. We find that in some cases complete removal will conflict with other policies regarding protection and restoration of reefs, as well as the conservation of species within the region. Key ecological considerations that are rarely considered during decommissioning decisions are: (i) provision of reef habitat, (ii) productivity of offshore ecosystems, (iii) enhancement of biodiversity, (iv) protection of the seabed from trawling, and (v) enhancement of connectivity.

In the present study, the AChE inhibiting potential of organic extracts of production water (produced water) from oil and gas production platforms in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was determined in an in vitro bioassay based on commercially available purified AChE from the electric organ of Electrophorus electricus (L.). The results from the studies show that produced water contains a combination of AChE inhibiting compounds and compounds stimulating AChE enzymatic activity. The AChE inhibition was predominantly caused by unidentified aromatic compounds in the oil/particulate fraction of produced water, whereas polar compounds in both the water soluble and oil/particulate fraction of produced water caused an apparent stimulation of AChE activity. Substrate saturation studies with fixed concentrations of produced water extracts confirmed that the inhibition occurred in a non-destructive and competitive manner. The concentrations of AChE inhibitors (7.9-453 ng paraoxon-equivalents L-1, 2.2-178 mu g dichlorvos-equivalents L-1) were in many cases found to be several orders of magnitude higher than background levels. The findings demonstrate that produced water contains potentially neurotoxic compounds and suggest that further laboratory studies with fish or field studies in the vicinity of oil production facilities are highly warranted.

Slower maturation rates ( among fish <= 6 years old), lower GSI values and decreased spawning frequency were observed, and were especially pronounced in the northwestern Gulf. Furthermore, an Index of Reproductive Importance showed that young fish (ages 2-7) are contributing far less to the spawning stock in recent years, while older fish (> 8 years) are contributing more, when compared to fish from the same age groups sampled in the previous decade. Coincident with these changes in reproductive output, fishing pressure has steadily declined gulf-wide, and spawning stock biomass and spawning potential ratio have increased. Thus, it is possible that the age structure of the red snapper stock is becoming less truncated, or that reproductive effort observed is due to the temporary influence of recent strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 as they begin to reach full reproductive potential. If the latter is true, careful documentation of the stock's reproductive dynamics during a time of population growth provides new understanding at the meta-population spatial and decadal temporal scales. In contrast, if the former is true, a truncated age structure due to overharvest can limit the productivity of the Gulf red snapper stock. In addition, we have learned that red snapper females in the northwestern Gulf collected on natural reefs and banks have much higher reproductive output than those on artificial reefs in the form of standing and toppled oil and gas platforms, thus making the need to know the relative abundance of females found on these disparate habitats an important next step toward better-understanding factors impacting the reproductive dynamics of this species.",Yes,Ray,No,NA,Ray,NA,NA,NA,measured reproductive rates,,J,"Stefania, Gorbi; Maura, Benedetti; Claudia, Virno Lamberti; Barbara, Pisanelli; Ginevra, Moltedo; Francesco, Regoli",Biological effects of diethylene glycol (DEG) and produced waters (PWs) released from offshore activities: A multi-biomarker approach with the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,157,11,3166,3173,10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.021,Nov-09,2009,"Diethylene glycol (DEG) is largely used during oil and gas exploitation by offshore platforms.

(II) Marine ecological safety has not become the main concern of national security. Oil spills are disasters because humans spare no efforts to get economic benefits from oil.

Historically, such artificial reefs formed an important component of the socio-economic development of coastal fisheries. In comparison, modern artificial reefs have taken on a variety of forms. The most widely recognized are purpose-build modular artificial reefs designed for the enhancement of fisheries yield, diving, and various other benefits. However, far more common within the Gulf are the large-scale unplanned artificial reefs that have been formed as a result of human activities in the marine system, such as large-scale coastal breakwaters, seawalls, jetties, pipelines, and oil and gas infrastructure. Although there is limited information on the role of these constructions in structuring Gulf marine communities, increasing evidence suggests that abundant and diverse communities of reef fish, coral and other benthos can develop on these structures, with important ecological implications in urbanized coastal areas in the Gulf. However, due to a variety of unintended consequences of artificial reef development such structures may also pose challenges to coastal marine management. We review the current published literature on artificial reefs in the Gulf in order to improve our understanding of the role that these structures play in Gulf coastal ecosystems, and to further develop regional management of artificial reefs. We explore the various types of artificial reef that exist in the Gulf and examine the benefits and challenges that these structures represent for coastal ecology and economics.

Between 2004 and the installation of a containment system in 2019 MC20 became an in situ laboratory for a wide range of hydrocarbon in the sea-related research, including different methods of assessing the volumetric flow rate of hydrocarbons spanning different temporal scales. In 2017 a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and high-frequency (90 to 154kHz) broadband echosounder were deployed to assess the flow rate of liquid and gas phase hydrocarbons. Measurements of horizontal currents were combined with acoustic mapping to determine the rise velocity of the seep as it moved downstream. Models of the rise velocity for fluid particles were used to predict the size of oil droplets and gas bubbles in the seep. The amplitude and shape of the broadband acoustic backscatter were then used to differentiate between, and determine the flow rate of, hydrocarbons. Oil flow rate in the seep was estimated to be 56 to 86 barrels/day (mean =71barrels/day) while the flow rate of gaseous hydrocarbons was estimated to be 98 to 359m(3)/day (mean =229m(3)/day).Plain Language Summary The Mississippi Canyon block 20 (MC20) oil spill was the result of the toppling of an oil production platform during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Oil was released from the seafloor where it rose to the surface for 15years, until a containment system was installed over the leak in 2019. The spill area became a natural laboratory for studying oil released from the seafloor. A variety of measurements over different lengths of time were used to estimate the oil flow rate at MC20 including satellites, shipboard sonars, and sensors on underwater vehicles. We present results from a shipboard sonar method which measured a flow rate of 56 to 86 barrels per day. The value and range of the flow rate varied between the methods used at MC20. This difference could be due to differences among the length of time of measurements, for example, the shipboard sonar measurements were made over 4.5hr while the containment system measure for about 30days, or the difference could be due to differences in how the measurements are made. More research is needed to determine how the flow rate of oil rising from the seafloor varies over time to understand how flow rate measurements should be interpreted.Key PointsA shipboard broadband acoustic survey was performed at the site of a seafloor-sourced oil spill to determine the flow rate of hydrocarbons The rise rate and amplitude and shape of broadband backscatter determined the size, number, and identity (oil or gas) of targets The flow rate of liquid hydrocarbons was estimated to be between 56 and 86 barrels per day",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Kline, Richard J.; Khan, Izhar A.; Holt, G.

A pilot study was conducted to examine the distribution and abundance of rockfishes around Hidalgo (by scuba and by ROV photosurveys) and at eight adjacent natural reefs (by ROV photosurveys). To test for differences in fish assemblages among reefs using factorial ANOVA, the natural reefs were classified according to two levels each of three factors: ''low'' (0.2-0.5 m) versus ''high'' (>1 m) relief height; ''nearfield'' (<3 km from Hidalgo) versus ''farfield'' (>3 km from Hidalgo) proximity to the platform; and ''shallow'' (113-160 m) versus ''deep'' (195-213 m) reef depth. Fishes were also tagged over natural reefs with breakaway hook tags. Surveys and tagging studies were conducted from July to October 1990. During surveys in July and August, large numbers of young-of-the year (YOY) rockfishes (primarily Sebastes entomelas, S. flavidus and S. hopkinsi) were found in the surface and midwaters around Hidalgo. At the base of the platform, 1+ yr rockfishes (mainly S. entomelas and S. flavidus) were very abundant. When the platform was resurveyed in October, following the first gale of the year, nearly all the YOY rockfishes had disappeared, though the If yr fishes were still abundant at the platform's base. While the ultimate fate of the YOY rockfishes is not known, our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that Platform Hidalgo acts as a producer of fish biomass by providing recruitment habitat for pelagic larvae to settle and grow before dispersing as small juveniles. Both multivariate cluster analysis and univariate ANOVA show that the rockfish assemblage around Hidalgo is different in species composition and abundance from those over the natural reefs, although several species co-occur at the platform and the reefs. Three-way factorial ANOVA (without replication) suggests that among the natural reefs there are no statistically significant differences (at P less than or equal to 0.05) in abundances of rockfish populations or in diversity of rockfish assemblages due to the effect of relief height, depth, or proximity to the platform. However, pattern-recognition techniques (cluster analysis) reveal distinct groupings of these fauna that are related foremost to reef depth, followed by proximity to the platform and finally relief height. Fish density differed significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) between sampling times at selected sites. We propose that the factor relief height be dropped in subsequent definitive studies of these offshore reef assemblages.

Results: Patients receiving FOSL-HN experienced no untoward side effects compared with patients given O-HN and demonstrated the same general trend toward improved hepatic, renal and immune function found in the previous study. There was a significant reduction in PGE(2)(p<.03) and 6-keto PGF(1 alpha)(p<.01) production from PBMC with endotoxin stimulation in patients receiving FOSL-HN. Conclusions: The results of early enteral feeding with FOSL-HN after surgery in this follow-up study provide further support to claims of safety, tolerance, and improved physiologic function.

The expression of CYP1A, CYP2M1- and 2K1-like proteins was examined for use as possible biomarkers of PFW exposure. A pilot study on the Northwest Shelf of Australia had indicated that PFW contamination possibly contributes to induction of CYP1A-like proteins in Gold-Spotted Trevally (Carangoides fulvoguttatus). The pilot study samples were re-examined for CYP1A, and, in addition, CYP2K1/2M1-like proteins. In a subsequent caged fish study in the same location a second species, Stripey seaperch (Lutjanus carponotatus), caught at a clean site, were distributed to three caging sites in a PFW gradient from the Harriet A production platform: A (near-field), B (far-field) and C (a non-impacted reference site). Fish were sampled at time (T) T = 0, T = 3 and T = 10 days. Significant increases of CYP1A, one CYP2K1- and two CYP2M1-like proteins were noted at Site A at T = 10 d. For another CYP2K1-like protein, a significant increase was observed at Site A only at T = 3 d. These results support a previous study indicating that CYP1A protein is sensitive to PFW exposure. Importantly, statistically significant environmental induction of both CYP2M1- and CYP2K1-like proteins in tropical fish due to PFW exposure had not previously been described and induction of enzymes in the CYP2 family suggest new biomarkers for PFW. In addition, the novel response of one CYP2K-like protein requires further verification, but offers promise for improved monitoring of sub-lethal responses in marine organisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Edible oil powders are one such com-modity that is consumed for their several nutraceutical properties such as, reducing cardiovascular risk, aiding in weight reduction, providing antioxidant properties, etc. Edible oil is first stabilized into stable emulsions which are then processed to obtain powders. The process of oil-in-water emulsion stabilization is carried out using ultrasonication, homogenization, microfluidization, complex coacervation, and oil structuring mechanisms. The stable emulsions are then microencapsulated using various wall material combinations and ratios to form stable edible oil powders. The wall material protects the active molecules from the ambient environment, high tem-perature, and high-pressure processing methods. These powders are added to coffee, smoothies, cookies, yogurt, cake mix, and soup powder to impart functional properties to foods. The major challenge in the production of oil powder is the formation of stable emulsion with proper wall-to-core ratio and binding of the wall with core materials to form stable powder with an increased shelf life.

Major resource extraction industries (hydrocarbon production and fisheries) operate in the area, and, in addition to shipping and hunting, pose risks for marine birds. Understanding the relative risks has been hampered by poor information on bird distribution at sea. Here, we deployed global location sensors (loggers or geolocators) on common murres Uria aalge at Funk Island, the species' largest North American breeding colony. Adults (n=10) were resident on the Grand Bank and in adjacent pelagic waters year round. Within 10 days of leaving the colony, males dispersed offshore (<50 degrees W), southsouth-east of Funk Island. Females departed later and spent 10-47 days in coastal waters before moving offshore. All birds were in the vicinity of offshore oil platforms during November and December, but remained outside the area of the coastal Newfoundland and Labrador murre hunt. Three of six tracked females, but only one of four tracked males moved closer to shore during January and February where vulnerability to the hunt may have increased. Vessel-based surveys confirmed the importance of offshore, shelf-edge habitats for murres in winter.

Fishing and scuba diving have been the main economic activities in this area for decades. However, in recent years, there has been a bleaching process and a decrease of the coral colonies in Quintana Roo, Mexico. This drop is caused mainly by the production activities performed in the oil platforms and the presence of hurricanes among other climatic events.

In this study, Salix was first liquefied using ablative fast pyrolysis in a pilot scale unit.

Both routes resulted in significant deoxygen-ation (97 wt% versus 93 wt%). It is feasible to co-refine pyrolysis oil using both methods, the main difference being that the hydroprocessing results in a significantly higher biogenic carbon yield from the pyrolysis oil to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon products (92 wt%) but would in turn require input of H2.

Multivariate analysis on the total fish assemblage showed significant differences between wrecks and controls. Results also showed higher levels of species richness and abundance near all wrecks than at a short distance from them on soft bottoms, thus indicating that these sunken vessels, thanks to their higher habitat complexity, act as artificial reefs, attracting aggregations of fish species and leading to a greater diversification of the local fish assemblage.

There are three main sources of organic pollutants in the North Sea: atmospheric, land-based sources, and inputs from offshore gas and oil installations. All three sources contribute to elevated concentrations of organic pollutants in the North Sea compared to the Norwegian Sea. There is evidence that chlorinated organic contaminants were present in sufficiently high concentrations in the southern North Sea two decades ago, to alter embryonal development in fish. The results from extensive, long-term monitoring programs show that some diseases decreased whereas other increased in the southern North Sea and that, among other factors, contaminants may play a role in the temporal changes recorded in disease prevalence.

Agriculture is responsible for 27% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and is the largest contributing sector. Penetration of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors is falling short of targets, and there is no clear plan for achieving them. The anaerobic digestion of grass to produce biogas or biomethane is put forward as a multifaceted solution, which could help meet energy and emissions targets, reduce dependence on imported energy, and provide additional farm income. This paper addresses the economic viability of such a system. Grass biogas/biomethane fares poorly under the current combined heat and power tariff structure, which is geared toward feed-stock that attracts a gate fee. Tariff structures similar to those used in other countries are necessary for the industry to develop. Equally, regulation should be implemented to allow injection of biomethane into the gas grid in Ireland. Blends of natural gas and biomethane can be sold, offering a cost-competitive green fuel. Sale as a renewable transport fuel could allow profitability for the farmer and savings for the consumer, but suffers due to the lack of a market. Under current conditions, the most economically viable outlet for grass biomethane is sale as a renewable heating fuel. The key to competitiveness is the existing natural gas infrastructure that enables distribution of grass biomethane, and the renewable energy targets that allow renewable fuels to compete against each other.

The expression of CYP1A, CYP2M1- and 2K1-like proteins was examined for use as possible biomarkers of PFW exposure. A pilot study at the Harriet A production platform, on the Northwest Shelf of Australia, had indicated that PFW contamination possibly contributes to induction of CYP1A- and 2K1/2M1-like proteins in Gold-Spotted Trevally (Carangoides fulvoguttatus). In a subsequent caged fish study in the same location, Stripey seaperch (Lutjanus carponotatus) were caught at a clean site, then distributed to three caging sites: A (near-field), B (far-field) and C (a non-impacted reference site). Fish were sampled at time T = 0, 3 and 10 days. Significant increases of CYP1A, one CYP2K1- and two CYP2M1-like proteins were noted at Site A at T = 10. For another CYP2K1-like protein, a significant increase was observed at Site A only at T = 3. Prevailing winds changed between days 6 and 8 of sampling, moving the surface water plume directly west, possibly impacting in situ PFW exposure. The results indicate that tropical fish CYPIA protein is sensitive to PFW exposure. Importantly, statistically significant environmental induction of both CYP2M1- and CYP2K1-like proteins in tropical fish due to PFW exposure had not previously been described and CYP2 family induction may represent possible new biomarkers (other than CYP1A) of PFW exposure. In addition, the novel fraction-specific response of CYP2K-like proteins requires further verification but offers promise for improved monitoring of sub-lethal responses in marine organisms.

Due to its high biodiversity, living resources and energy resources, this region is strategic in the national plans for social and economic development of Mexico. The discovery of fossil fuel reserves in the seabed of Campeche Sound in the 1970s promoted the rapid expansion of the national oil industry in offshore waters. Unfortunately, the accidental blowout of the most productive well (Ixtoc-I) in June of 1979, caused the first world massive oil spill in a tropical marine environment. More than 3.4 million of barrels of crude oil were liberated in an ecosystem formerly renowned for its pristine conditions. In the aftermath of this dreadful accident, a growing concern emerged not only for the oil acute effects but also for the long-term environmental consequences derived from the residual hydrocarbon compounds accumulated in coastal environments of the southern Gulf of Mexico. The attempts to assess the magnitude of the environmental damage were strongly precluded by the lack of pre-spill information.

The Block Island Wind Farm is a five-turbine, 30-MW wind array located about 6 km off the coast of Rhode Island and has been in operation since 2016.Methods We conducted a 4-day acoustical and biological survey of the area during daylight hours to gain insight on the spatial distribution of fish species in and around the turbines. We utilized a hull-mounted, downward-looking Simrad 38-/200-kHz ES70 and a pole-mounted iXblue SeapiX steerable Mills Cross, 150-kHz, 1.6 degrees resolution multibeam echosounder oriented downward to map the two- and three-dimensional distributions using spiral and straight-line transect patterns. We collected fish by using hook and line to verify the sources of acoustic backscatter and to measure length, sex, and diet.Result Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata were the most commonly caught species and appeared to be the primary constituents of the fish aggregations that were mapped by the acoustic systems. We found increased levels of acoustic backscatter within 200 m of the turbine structures, suggesting that they were attractive structures.Conclusion These levels were not greater than backscatter levels in the surrounding area, suggesting that the proximate effect of the wind array was spatially limited.",Yes,Shayna,No,No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,acoustic monitoring of fish abundance,,J,"Gates, Andrew R.; Benfield, Mark C.; Booth, David J.; Fowler, Ashley M.; Skropeta, Danielle; Jones, Daniel O.

In this time scientists from universities and research institutions have made more than 120 visits to oil rigs, drill ships and survey vessels operated by 16 oil companies, in order to work with the industry's Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Visits have taken place in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Australasia at water depths from 100 m to nearly 3000 m. The project has directly produced > 40 peer reviewed publications and data from the project's > 2600 entry online image and video archive have been used in many others. The aim of this paper is to highlight examples of how valuable data can be obtained through collaboration with hydrocarbon exploration and production companies to use existing industry infrastructure to increase scientific discovery in unexplored areas and augment environmental monitoring of industrial activity.The large number of industry ROVs operating globally increases chance encounters with large, enigmatic marine organisms. SERPENT video observations include the deepest known records of species previously considered epipelagic such as scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and southern sunfish (Mola ramsayi) and the first in situ observations of pelagic species such as oarfish (Regalecus glesne). Such observations enable improvements to distribution records and description of behaviour of poorly understood species. Specimen collection has been used for taxonomic descriptions, functional studies and natural products chemistry research. Anthropogenic effects been assessed at the local scale using in situ observations and sample collection at the time of drilling operations and subsequent visits have enabled study of recovery from drilling.Future challenges to be addressed using the SERPENT approach include ensuring unique faunal observations by industry ROV operators are reported, further study of recovery from deep-water drilling activity and to carry out in situ studies to improve the understanding of potential future decommissioning of obsolete hydrocarbon infrastructure.

Application of this model to the GOOMEX results implies involvement of both toxicity and organic enrichment. Results of toxicity tests and comparisons of observed contaminant concentrations to known effects levels imply that metals drive the toxicity response. We conclude that (1) long-lasting effects of drilling activity exist in the sedimentary environment around gas production platforms, (2) dual effects of toxicity and organic enrichment probably drive readily detectable responses in benthic meiofauna and macroinfauna to 100-200 m, and (3) the failure to detect evidence of exposure or sublethal impacts on fishes and most larger invertebrates is a joint consequence of their mobility over the relevant scales of environmental change and their negligible exposure to hydrocarbons and other contaminants.",No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Zha, Cheng; Min, Weidong; Han, Qing; Li, Wei; Xiong, Xin; Wang, Qi; Zhu, Meng",SAR ship localization method with denoising and feature refinement,ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,123,,,,10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106444,Aug-23,2023,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection is greatly important to marine transportation monitoring and fishery resource management. To improve the detection accuracy of small ships, an SAR ship localization method with Denoising and Feature Refinement (DFR) is proposed in this paper. It consists of three parts. The first part is the denoising module, which uses non-local mean to suppress the speckle noise of the SAR image. The second part is Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module. It can integrate more low-level features by adding skip connections. This prevents the low-level spatial position information of the fused features from being diluted by high-level semantic information, therefore it is beneficial to the detection of small ships. The third part is a center-based ship predictor with Feature Refinement (FR). The FR module is proposed to refine the features and reduce the background interference, which is conducive to locate ships more accurately. Extensive experiments are conducted. The experimental results show that after adding the denoising and FR modules, the value of AP0.5 is increased by 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, which proves the effectiveness of these two modules.

The processing facility, a pilot plant with a limited production capacity located in the proximity of the production field, included a platform for oil production and transesterification. The oil yields of the two high-oleic varieties were around 35% with respect to seed weight. The sunflower seed oils obtained fulfilled most of the quality requirements for the use of vegetable oils as engine fuels. The production of biodiesel was carried out in the transesterification unit. However, the production and the direct use of the sunflower seed oil seemed to be a more suitable option than its conversion to biodiesel, especially at a small scale like that considered in this study. The possible exploitation of seed pressing co-product (sunflower cake) as solid biofuel was assessed. The relatively high calorific value (21 MJ kg(-1)) and the low moisture content (<15%) made it an interesting option for thermal applications.

The annual formation of growth increments in otoliths was validated in-situ using tetracycline mark-recapture methods to confirm that increments are formed annually. Garibaldi grew significantly larger on artificial reefs than on natural reefs but tended to live longer on paired natural reefs.

Produced water that meets effluent limitations for total oil and grease contains low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, low molecular weight organic acids, and several metals. The U.S. EPA has expressed concern that some of these chemicals could be bioaccumulated to potentially toxic concentrations by marine organisms in the receiving waters of offshore produced water discharges. This paper presents the results of an intensive monitoring study to determine if marine animals bioaccumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from produced water discharges to offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Two platform pairs, each consisting of a produced water-discharging platform and a nearby non-discharging reference platform were selected for monitoring in offshore waters (90 to 260 m depth) of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Produced water, ambient sea water, two species of bivalve mollusks, and several species of fish were collected from each platform pair. Forty PAH analytes, including parent and alkyl PAHs, were analyzed in all samples. The two discharging platforms discharged an average of 1.75 million L/d and 1.13 million L/d of produced water containing 30 to 43 mug/L (ppb) and 24 to 51 mug/L of PAHs, respectively. More than 90 percent of the PAHs were naphthalene and alkylnaphthalenes. The two bivalves, jewel boxes and thorny oysters, collected from legs of the platforms, contained up to 800 ng/g dry wt (ppb) total PAHs in their soft tissues. Muscle tissues of fish collected from the platform pairs contained <1 to 120 ng/g dry wt total PAHs. The dominant PAHs in the bivalve tissues were alkylnaphthalenes, fluorenes, phenanthrenes, and dibenzothiophenes, all characteristic of a petroleum source. A few individual PAHs were present at a significantly higher concentration in tissues of thorny oysters, but not jewel boxes, from one of the produced water-discharging platforms than from the paired reference platform. The relative concentrations of different PAHs in oysters was different than that in the produced water. The evidence for bioaccumulation of PAHs from produced water by shellfish was considered weak and inconclusive, because bioaccumulation of petroleum-derived PAHs was demonstrated in only one instance, and the source(s) of the PAHs was unclear. Concentrations of individual PAHs in fish muscle were low. Higher concentrations of individual PAHs were detected with similar frequency in fish from the reference and discharging platforms. Thus, the fish were not bioaccumulating PAHs from the produced water discharges.

With an overall accuracy of 85.84%, the model shows oil palm expansion is driven by price changes, spatial distribution of production costs, and a spatial contagion effect.

To make up for reduced production from maturing fields, oil and gas exploration activities on the Norwegian continental shelf have greatly increased over the past several years. Strict emission controls have resulted in a substantial reduction in the release of hazardous chemicals. However, because of the increased exploration the discharges of water-based drill cuttings and muds have increased substantially, temporarily increasing water column sediment loads. The stony coral Lophelia pertusa is the most widely distributed and well-studied of the structure forming cold water corals (CWC) and it thrives in Norwegian waters where many reefs are located in the vicinity of oil platforms or exploration areas. This species provides habitat for a diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates and fishes, including commercially valuable species. High sediment loads are known to negatively affect adult corals, but impacts on the early life history stages are unknown. We investigated the effects of a range of drill cutting concentrations (0.5-640 ppm) on larvae of L. pertusa at ages five days and 15-20 days. One set of experiments was conducted in static experimental chambers that exposed larvae to decreasing concentrations over time, and the other maintained continuous drill cutting concentrations for the duration of the experiment (24 h). Increased sediment load for a duration of 24 h caused significant larval mortality, but there was an age-dependent difference in sensitivity of larvae. Younger larvae were significantly more susceptible to lower concentrations of drill cuttings than older larvae, while the older larvae were significantly more affected at higher concentrations. Five day old larvae were affected at treatment concentration 40 ppm. The larval cilia became clogged, preventing the larvae from swimming actively and ultimately causing mortality. Larvae of many species use cilia for swimming and feeding, so negative impacts of increased sediment may not be limited to corals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Alkylphenols, including 4-tert-butylphenol (C-4), 4n-pentylphenol (C-5), 4n-hexylphenol (C-6), and 4n-heptylphenol (C-7) up to 237 ppb concentrations, have been detected in produced water from oil platforms. Previous studies have shown that alkylphenols induce vitellogenesis in fish. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) of both sexes were force-fed with various doses ranging between 0.02 and 80 ppm of a mixture of alkylphenols (C-4:C-5:C-6:C-7 ratio 1: 1: 1: 1) or 5 ppm 17beta-estradiol. We investigated effects on hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A protein expression in protein blots, using antibodies against scup (Stenotomus chrysops) CYP1A1 and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) CYP3A. There was asexually dimorphic expression of CYP1A and CYP3A protein levels, with females expressing higher levels than males. Treatment of male Atlantic cod with 17beta-estradiol resulted in increased CYP1A and CYP3A protein levels. Exposure to alkylphenols resulted in a dose-dependent increase of CYP1A and CYP3A protein expression in males, but not in females. However, this increase of CYP1A protein levels was not reflected on the CYP1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, implying that alkylphenols inhibited the CYP1A enzyme activity in vivo. In vitro inhibition studies with pooled liver microsomes from Atlantic cod confirmed that the alkylphenols mixture efficiently inhibited the CYP1A activity (IC50 = 10 muM), although the inhibitory effect of each individual alkylphenol varied. The IC50 values for each individual alkylphenol on the CYP1A activity were, in a descending order of magnitude: [C-7 > C-6 > C-5 much greater than C-4], ranging from 12 to 300 muM with decreased length of the 4-alkyl chain. The effect of alkylphenols on the CYP3A activity in vitro in liver microsomes also was investigated, using the fluorescent 7-benzyloxy-4-[trifluoromethyl]-coumarin (BFC) as a diagnostic CYP3A substrate. The alkylphenol mixture inhibited CYP3A activity with IC50 value at 100 muM. The IC50 values for each individual alkylphenol on CYP3A activity were, in a descending order of magnitude: [C-5 > C-6 > C-7 > C-4] ranging between 60 and 250 muM. Taken together, our results show that the alkylphenol mixture and 17beta-estradiol resulted in elevated hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A expression in male Atlantic cod. The alkylphenol mixture strongly inhibited CYP1A activities, whereas it weakly inhibited CYP3A activity in Atlantic cod liver microsomes in vitro. In addition, 17beta-estradiol was a weak inhibitor of CYP3A activity (IC50 = 75 muM) and did not notably inhibit the CYP1A activity in vitro. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

There remains a paucity of information on the habitat value of these structures for fishery target species and, as a result, little understanding of how decommissioning should be conducted to minimise impacts to populations of these economically and socially important species. We assess the diversity and abundance of species that are targets of recreational and commercial fisheries on 33 subsea wells and 17 pipelines across the tropical northwest and temperate southeast marine regions of Australia. We examine relationships between fish identity and abundance and a range of environmental (e.g., depth, location), infrastructure-specific (e.g., pipeline position, diameter, age, length of pipeline, height of well, position on well), and biological (% cover of epibiota) variables using video filmed by remotely operated vehicles during their routine offshore inspection and maintenance campaigns. A total of 100 fishery target species were observed across subsea well and pipeline infrastructure, 56 species uniquely observed on pipelines and nine unique to wells. The families Lutjanidae (snapper), Serranidae (rock cods, groupers, perch), and Carangidae (trevallies) were most common and abundant on both wells and pipelines. In the northwest, lutjanids were most abundant around the base of wells, in shallow depths, on shorter wells, and where pipelines spanned the seafloor. A greater number of fishery target species and abundance of ocean perch (Helicolenus spp.) were also associated with pipelines that spanned the seafloor in temperate southeast Australia. The combined biomass of three species of snapper on wells in the northwest was 1,270 kg, with production levels for these species on each well estimated to be 105.2 g m(2) year(-1).

In production, achieving dry crude oil and clean water is a key requirement for uninterrupted operation. Minimizing the buildup of unresolved emulsion at the oil-water interface is another closely related element in the overall process of demulsification. Most oilfield emulsions are never completely resolved before being sent downstream for refining. For example, Karl Fisher measurements always show some water present in the oil phase. Investigations were performed to probe select features of unresolved emulsions. Using the American Society for Testing and Materials D4807-88 procedure, which involves diluting samples with hot toluene, emulsion solids were isolated and then studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. The characterization of the solids from several different oilfield emulsions revealed interesting structures that might be called salt spheres or salt scaffolds. These skeletal structures appear to outline once existent water droplets. In one case study, partly flocculated or coalesced salt structures were identified. The occurrence of these more complex structures gives the impression that the demulsification process was frozen in time. In another study, a partially filled salt sphere was isolated. Such a structure would likely remain with the crude oil in downstream processing as undesaltable solids and cause corrosion in the high-temperature process vessels as well as contribute to the poisoning of catalyst beds.

Besides standard boxcorer samples, hauls were made with the Triple-D dredge in order to collect relatively rare and larger species. Multivariate analysis showed a distinct difference between the Triple-D samples from the fishery-closed area around the platform and those from the regularly trawled reference subareas. Conspicuous differences were higher abundances of mud shrimps (Callianassa subterranea, Upogebia deltaura) and sensitive bivalves (Arctica islandica, Thracia convexa, Dosinia lupinus, Abra nitida, Cultellus pellucidus) in the non-fished subarea near the platform. Species richness and evenness were higher as well. The boxcore samples did not clearly reveal the distinctness of the non-fished platform subarea. This is attributed to the large proportion of small, short-living species and the relatively low numbers of vulnerable larger species common to all boxcore samples. Nevertheless, boxcore samples did confirm the higher abundance of mud shrimps (Callianassa subterranea, Upogebia deltaura) in the non-fished platform subarea and demonstrated higher densities of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis.

Patients on total parenteral nutrition depend on lipid emulsions for their tocopherol intake. In the present study, we analysed the content of tocopherol isoforms in various lipid emulsions. We also tested the hypothesis that immune-modulating effects of lipid emulsions could be attributed to different concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-toc) or peroxidation products.Method; alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-toc were measured in emulsions containing long-chain triglycerides (LCT), mixed long- and medium-chain triglycerides (LCT/MCT), structured lipids (SL), olive oil (OO) or fish oil (FO). As a measure for cellular activation, neutrophil membrane adhesion markers were assessed after exposure to two LCT/MCTemulsions that differ only in alpha-toc content.Results: Various emulsions differed widely in tocopherol contents, especially with respect to the alpha-isoform. The latter isomer also was subject to considerable degradation despite adequate storage conditions. The previously observed activation of neutrophils by LCT/MCT was not influenced by the increased concentration of alpha-toc or the decreased concentration of lipid peroxidation products in a new LCT/MCTemulsion.Conclusions.-Tocopherol supplementation by parenteral lipid emulsions strongly depends on the lipid source and the storage lifetime of the emulsion. The effects of LCT/MCT on the immune system are not modulated by alpha-toc or by lipid peroxidation products. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The impacts of volatile flavor substances, the chroma value, quality and structure characteristics, microscopic structure, and the types and content of volatile flavor substances were also analyzed. The results showed that after drying and sterilization, the L* value, W value and delta-E value of fish cakes decreased significantly from 77.12 to 64.77, 66.21 to 52.57, 10.46 to 24.50, respectively. However, a* value and b* value increased significantly from 0.30 to 6.97 and 24.85 to 30.89, respectively. The elasticity, hardness, and chewiness increased significantly with the drying process but decreased significantly with the increased sterilization temperature. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that the internal pores of the fish cakes became smaller, and the tissue structure was closer after drying. Gas chromatography-ion mobile spectrometry analysis identified a total of 36 volatile flavor compounds. Among these, ketones comprised the largest content, aldehydes represented the largest variety, and all volatile compounds contributed significantly to the flavor of fish cake. PCA results and nearest-neighbor fingerprint analysis showed that there were obvious differences in volatile flavor compounds between different treatments. In summary, this study conducted a detailed comparative analysis of the quality and flavor of fish cakes subjected to different processing methods.

PCB congeners 77 and 118 were selected for comparison purposes due to pronounced differences in mean adsorption efficiency and molecular geometry; triolein, a triacylglycerol of oleic acid (C18:1), was used as the representative fish oil component. Graphitic carbon structure was set up to serve as activated carbon model. Molecular force fields employed in the simulations combined short-range parameters from the OPLS with partial atomic charges obtained via quantum chemical calculations using DFT/B3LYP/6-31**G(+) and Solvation Model 6. We modified the dihedral angle potential between the PCB aromatic rings and applied Schrodinger's Jaguar package to evaluate the required force field constants. Our complete system comprised a number of PCB molecules dissolved in triacylglycerol that overlaid and filled the pores of an AC structure. The production run of 4 ns provided strong indications that smaller pores will be conductive to better selectivity though also resulted in certain doubts concerning the estimation and assignment of partial atomic charges on the activated carbon. The majority of PCB molecules trapped in pores were attached via cl-AC bonding, leaving the main part of the PCB molecule free to interact with triolein. The cl-AC adsorption energy was found to surpass the energy criteria conventionally used for hydrogen bonds. Planar orientation assumed by a PCB molecule in a very energetically favored position on top of the graphite sheet clearly supported the pi-cloud overlap hypothesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the last 20 years, there have been increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of large increases in the amounts of PW released into the North Sea. We have previously shown that low levels of APs can induce disruption of the endocrine and reproductive systems of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The aims of this follow-up study were to: (i) identify the lowest observable effect concentration of APs; (ii) study the effects of exposure to real PW, obtained from a North Sea oil-production platform; and (iii) study the biological mechanism of endocrine disruption in female cod. Fish were fed with feed paste containing several concentrations of four different APs (4-tert-butylphenol, 4-n-pentylphenol, 4-n-hexylphenol and 4-n-heptylphenol) or real PW for 20 weeks throughout the normal period of vitellogenesis in Atlantic cod from October to January. Male and female cod, exposed to AP and PW, were compared to unexposed fish and to fish fed paste containing 17 beta-oestradiol (E-2). Approximately 60% of the females and 96% of the males in the unexposed groups were mature at the end of the experiment. Our results show that exposure to APs and E-2 have different effects depending on the developmental stage of the fish. We observed that juvenile females are advanced into puberty and maturation, while gonad development was delayed in both maturing females and males. The AP-exposed groups contained increased numbers of mature females, and significant differences between the untreated group and the AP-treated groups were seen down to a dose of 4 mu g AP/kg body weight. In the high-dose AP and the E-2 exposed groups, all females matured and no juveniles were seen. These results suggest that AP-exposure can affect the timing of the onset of puberty in fish even at extremely low concentrations. Importantly, similar effects were not seen in the fish that were exposed to real PW. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring the efficacy of artificial reefs in these capacities requires both fine- and large-scale direct comparisons between natural and artificial reef structures. We conducted mobile active acoustic surveys to examine intra-reef and regional spatial patterns of acoustic fish backscatter in similar to 2 km(2) survey areas over 14 natural and 17 artificial reefs along the northwestern Florida continental shelf. Nested generalized additive models (GAMs) showed that intra-reef backscatter from fish at natural reefs was diffused throughout the survey area forming low density patches, whereas backscatter at artificial reefs was concentrated in high density hot-spots that were constricted horizontally within a mean of 116 m away from the structure. The exact distance from artificial structures at which backscatter was decreased to background levels, termed the area of influence, was found to be mediated by reef longitude, relief, area, and depth. On a regional scale, hierarchical GAMs (HGAMs) which incorporated altitude from the seafloor explained a larger proportion of deviance in backscatter than either latitude or longitude at both habitat types, indicating that the horizontal distribution of backscatter at these habitats varied throughout the water column. Trends in the horizontal distribution of backscatter were primarily driven by scatterers within 20 m of the seafloor at natural reefs and within 10 m of the surface at both natural and artificial reefs. HGAMs which examined only the horizontal distribution of backscatter showed a negative gradient of fish backscatter at natural reefs from west to east along the northwestern Florida continental shelf which was significantly influenced by reef depth. At both reef types, backscatter from fish was highest in the bottom 10 m of the water column and declined significantly with increasing altitude from the seafloor.",Yes,Shayna,No,No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Park, Kiyoul; Sanjaya, Sanju A.; Quach, Truyen; Cahoon, Edgar B.",Toward sustainable production of value-added bioenergy and industrial oils in oilseed and biomass feedstocks,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY,13,10,1610,1623,10.1111/gcbb.12883,Oct-21,2021,"Plant fatty acids are used for food, feed, fuel, and industrial materials.

The sensitivity of such a sensor plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the method. In our preliminary study a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunches is proposed. The design of the proposed air coil sensor based on an inductive sensor is further investigated to improve its sensitivity. This paper investigates the results pertaining to the effects of the air coil structure of an oil palm fruit sensor, taking consideration of the used copper wire diameter ranging from 0.10 mm to 0.18 mm with 60 turns. The flat-type shape of air coil was used on twenty samples of fruitlets from two categories, namely ripe and unripe. Samples are tested with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 120 MHz. The sensitivity of the sensor between air to fruitlet samples increases as the coil diameter increases. As for the sensitivity differences between ripe and unripe samples, the 5 mm air coil length with the 0.12 mm coil diameter provides the highest percentage difference between samples and it is amongst the highest deviation value between samples. The result from this study is important to improve the sensitivity of the inductive oil palm fruit sensor mainly with regards to the design of the air coil structure.

Analysis of the essential oil composition of thirty-three germplasm identified four chemical groups: a '1,8-cineole' type, a 'verbenone' type, a 'camphor' type, and a 'alpha-pinene' type. Application of fractional factorial analysis of variance to the data indicated interactions of volatile by germplasm, volatile by method (hydro-distillation or solvent extraction), and volatile by season (summer 2017 or winter 2018), but not for germplasm by method, germplasm by season or method by season. This suggests that the germplasm was seasonally stable. Yet, the interaction between volatile by method pointed out that more camphor and 1,8-cineole were obtained by distillation, whereas more alpha-pinene was obtained by solvent extraction.

Particularly locations where oil based muds (OBM) had been used and discharged received attention. A general outcome of these studies was that 6 to 8 years after OBM cutting discharges elevated oil concentrations and associated biological effects still occurred within a few hundred meters from well sites. Although contamination levels generally seemed to have decreased compared to the situation shortly after drilling, it was argued that oil had not completely disappeared at any of the locations investigated, although there were clear signs of ecological recovery. Nevertheless it remained unclear to what extent recovery would continue at the longer term. Therefore the parties involved in the convenant between the Dutch government (represented by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works) and the oil companies (represented by NOGEPA) decided to continue monitoring sediment conditions at the long term. In spring 2005 a renewed monitoring exercise was carried out including sediment sampling near four well sites in the Dutch sector, where OBM cuttings had been discharged 18 to 21 years ago. The locations were situated in the southern erosion area (1 location), the northern sedimentation area (2 locations) and the transition zone in between (1 location) respectively. At each location a compendious survey was carried out, during which sediments were sampled at 5 stations between 25 and 1000 m from the discharge site. At three locations a production platform was present, the fourth location has been abandoned immediately after an exploration drilling had been finished. This location could possibly give an indication of the impact of beamtrawl fishing, which is not allowed within 500 m from platforms, on the longterm distribution of discharged material. At all locations chemical analyses were performed to assess oil concentrations in the sediment. These analyses were carried out and reported by TNO. For the platform locations a complete fauna analysis was carried out to detect possible effects on the macrobenthic community. For the abandoned well site only the numbers of sea urchins Echinocardium cordatum (an OBM sensitive species) in the samples were counted. In this report the results of the biological analyses are presented, whereas the results of the chemical analyses are shortly summarized. The results and conclusions of this study may be summarized as follows: 1. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: Slight contamination levels occurred up to at least 100 m, but to less than 250 m from the platform. Oil seems to have disappeared for the greater part after 18 years. 2. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: A clear effect on the benthic community could only be observed at the station nearest to the platform (40 m). Here the fauna was substantially impoverished. 3. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: The sea urchin Echinocardium cordatum seemed to be affected in its abundance up to 250 m from the platform. 4. Platform K12-a, transition zone: The sediment conditions seem to have considerably improved compared to the first 7 years after the discharges but slightly elevated oil concentrations occurred up to at least 100 m from the platform. Patchiness in the distribution of discharged material may have camouflaged the presence of local higher contamination levels. 5. Platform K12-a, transition zone: At 35 m from the platform the benthic fauna was clearly affected. The fauna composition at this station was different and substantially poorer than at stations further away from the platform. 6. Platform K12-a, transition zone: At 100 m the benthic community seemed to be only slightly affected. 7. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At stations 250 m and further away from the platform contamination seems to have decreased to values below background level. 8. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 100 m oil concentrations in the superficial sediment layers (0 - 10 cm) had decreased to values just beyond background level. However in the deeper sediment layers no decrease was observed. 9. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 100 m the fauna seemed to be not or hardly affected, in spite of the presence of oil in the sediment. 10. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 45 m from the platform the sediment was severely contaminated. The oil concentration (32 g per kg dry sediment) was higher than ever measured near L4-a. The chromatogram of the sediment sample was different from those usually found near old OBM locations and indicated that the oil was not or hardly weathered. This has led to the idea that the oil could be rather 'fresh'. However, no recent source of contamination is known. It is argued that most probably anaerobic conditions have inhibited bacterial degradation and weathering of the OBM base oil, that was discharged here 19 years ago. 11. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 45 m from the platform the benthic fauna was severely impoverished. Most species that were common or even abundant further away from the platform were absent or occurred in very low densities. 12. Location G13-1, sedimentation area, abandoned well site: A measurable effect of beamtrawl fishing on the distribution of discharged material could not be demonstrated. As a consequence of the very patchy distribution of the discharged material, a much more extensive sampling program would be necessary to detect such an effect. 13. After 20 years, oil contaminated surface sediments (top 10 cm) generally occur up to somewhere between 100 m and 250 m from platforms. The concentrations measured are slightly beyond background level, but give an underestimation of the contamination present, since oil usually accumulates in the deeper sediment layers. 14. Measurable effects on the macrobenthic community are generally limited to an area within 100 m from platforms after 20 years. 15.

Excluding Japanese sardine, production of the small pelagic species was higher during 1960s and 1990s but lower during 1970s and 1980s. This variation pattern generally corresponds with the trend in water temperature, warmer before early 1960s and after 1990s but colder during 1970s and 1980s. The warm-water, large predatory fishes and cold water demersal species show opposite responses to the water temperature in the TWC region, indicating the significant impact of oceanic conditions on fisheries production of the Japan/East Sea. Declines in demersal fishes and invertebrates during 1970s and 1980s suggested some impact of fishing. MTL and DI show a similar variation pattern: higher during 1960s and 1990s but lower during 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the sharp decline during the 1980s resulted from the abundant sardine catches, suggesting that dominant species have a large effect oil the structure of the fish community in the Japan/East Sea. Principal component analysis for 58 time-series data sets of fisheries catches suggested that the fish community varied oil inter-annual to inter-decadal scales; the abrupt changes that occurred in the mid-1970s and late 1980s seemed to correspond closely with the climatic regime shifts in the North Pacific. These results strongly suggest that the structure of the fish community in the Japan/East Sea was largely affected by climatic and oceanic regime shifts rather than by fishing. There is no evidence showing fishing down food webs in the Japan/East Sea. However, in addition to the impacts of abrupt shifts that occurred in the late 1980s, the large predatory and demersal fishes seem to be facing stronger fishing pressure with the collapse of the Japanese sardine.

In this life cycle assessment (LCA) the environmental impact of a biorefinery approach of pyrolysis oil from forestry residues or maize digestate and its application as wood modification treatment is determined. The damage to ecosystems, damage to human health and the increased resource scarcity is studied using an attributional LCA and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Based on data from an existing pyrolysis plant, it is shown that pyrolysis oil from maize digestate has a significantly higher environmental impact than pyrolysis oil from forestry residues. This is due to a lower energetic yield and a higher ash content in the feedstock. The biorefinery approach of using pyrolytic sugars as wood modification treatment shows significantly lower environmental impacts than the fossil-based creosotes, regardless of the selected end of life scenario, due to a lower toxicity and by a reduction of 82% of greenhouse gases. This shows that in addition to energy production, pyrolysis oil can be applied as biobased chemicals and materials, developing a sustainable platform based on pyrolysis oil.",No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Krone, R.; Dederer, G.; Kanstinger, P.; Kraemer, P.; Schneider, C.; Schmalenbach, I.",Mobile demersal megafauna at common offshore wind turbine foundations in the German Bight (North Sea) two years after deployment - increased production rate of Cancer pagurus,MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,123,,53,61,10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.11.011,Feb-17,2017,"Within the next decades the construction of thousands of different types of large wind turbine foundations in the North Sea will substantially increase the amount of habitat available to reef fauna. To gain first insights which effect these substantial changes in habitat structure and diversity might have on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared the mobile demersal megafauna associated with the common types of wind turbine foundations ('jacket', 'tripod' and 'monopile with scour protections of natural rock') in the southern German Bight, North Sea. Monopiles with scour protection were mostly colonized by typical reef fauna. They were inhabited by an average of about 5000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus (per foundation), which is more than twice as much as found at the foundation types without scour protection. Strong evidence was found that all three foundation types not only function as aggregation sites, but also as nursery grounds for C. pagurus. Assuming equal shares of the three foundation types in future wind farms, we project that about 27% of the local stock of C. pagurus might be produced on site. When, for example, comparing the existing fauna at 1000 ship wrecks and on the autochthonous soft substrate with those which probably will establish at the foundations of 5000 hypothetically realized wind turbines, it becomes clear that the German Bight in the future will provide new artificial reef habitats for another 320% crabs (C. pagurus) and 50% wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) representing substrata-limited mobile demersal hard bottom species.

However, like other energy production methods, hydrogen comes with challenges, including high costs and safety concerns across its entire value chain. To overcome these, low-cost productions are required along with a promised market. Offshore renewables have an enormous potential to facilitate green hydrogen production on a large scale. Their plummeting cost, technological advances, and rising cost of carbon pave a pathway where green hydrogen can be cost-competitive against fossil-fuel-based hydrogen. Offshore industries, including oil and gas, aquaculture, and shipping, are looking for cleaner energy solutions to decarbonize their systems/operations and can serve as a substantial market. Offshore industrial nexus, moreover, can assist the production, storage, and transmission of green hydrogen through infrastructure sharing and logistical support. The development of offshore green hydrogen production facilities is in its infancy and requires a deeper insight into the key elements that govern decision-making during their life-cycle.

This method detects the causal relationship between the variables under the bi-variate modelling approach. More importantly, the CQ procedure divulges the bearish and bullish states of the causal association between the variables under short, medium and long memories.FindingsThe authors find that aggregate measures of geopolitical risk reduce food prices in the short term in the Eastern Europe but increases food prices in the Western Europe. Besides, the decomposed measures of geopolitical risk threats and acts have heterogeneous effects on the food prices. More importantly, Russia's geopolitical risk events and global energy prices enhance the food inflation under long memory.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors provide diverse policy implications for Eastern and Western Europe based on the authors' findings. First, the European policymakers should take concrete and joint policy measures to tackle the detrimental effects of geopolitical risks to bring stability to the food markets. Second, this region should emphasize utilizing their unused agricultural lands to grow more crops to avoid external dependence on food. Third, the European Union and its partners should begin global initiatives to help smallholder farmers because of their contribution to the resilience of disadvantaged, predominantly rural communities. Fourth, geopolitically affected European countries like Ukraine should deal with a crippled supply chain to safeguard their production infrastructure. Fifth, fuel (oil) scarcity in the European region due to the Russia-Ukraine war should be mitigated by searching for alternative sources (countries) for smooth food transportation for trade. Finally, as Europe and its Allies impose new sanctions in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, it can have immediate and long-run disastrous consequences on the European and the global total food systems.

PW is difficult to monitor as releases are rapidly diluted and concentrations can reach trace levels. The use of passive samplers can over come this. Here polyethylene (PE) was calibrated for a diverse range of PW pollutants. Zebrafish were exposed to dilutions of PW and passive sampler extracts in order to investigate the relationship between freely dissolved chemical concentrations and acute toxic effects. The raw PW had an LC50 of 13% (percentage of PW in the standardized zebrafish medium). Observed non-viable deformations to embryos (at 5 hpf) included heart and yolk edema, head, spine and tail deformations. The dose-response relationship of lethal effects showed that if 0.0041 g of PE is exposed to this PW, then extracted, 50% of exposed D. rerio will suffer lethal effects. The sum of tested freely dissolved concentrations that led to 50% lethal effects (mortality and non-viable deformations) was 2.32 x 10(-4) mg/L for PW and 7.92 x 10(-2) mg/L for PE. This implies that exposure to raw PW was more toxic than exposure to PE extracts. This toxicity was attributed both to the presence of contaminants as well as PW salinity. Passive samplers are able to detect very low freely dissolved pollutant concentrations which is important for assessing the spatial dilution of PW releases. Bioassays provide complimentary information as they account for all toxic compounds including those that are not taken up by passive samplers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed paleoceanographic studies have documented abrupt changes in these processes over timescales ranging from centuries to millennia. Most of these major shifts in oceanic productivity and biodiversity are attributable to changes in Earth's climate, manifested through large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions. By comparison, contemporary biodiversity and plankton community dynamics are generally considered to be static, in part due to the lack of a suitable time frame of reference, and the absence of oceanic data to document ecosystem change over relatively short timescales (decades to centuries). Here we show that the average concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a) and the estimated rates of primary production in the surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) off Hawaii have more than doubled while the concentrations of dissolved silicate and phosphate have decreased during the past three decades. These changes are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of chl b, suggesting a shift in phytoplankton community structure. We hypothesize that these observed ecosystem trends and other related biogeochemical processes in the upper portion of the NPSG are manifestations of plankton community succession in response to climate variations. The hypothesized photosynthetic population domain shift toward an ecosystem dominated by prokaryotes has altered nutrient flux pathways and affected food web structure, new and export production processes, and fishery yields.

However, the degree to which sea otters may actually be affected by human-caused oil spills or exposure to natural oil seeps is currently unknown. Between 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey and collaborating agencies conducted a telemetry-based study of sea otters in Santa Barbara channel, in order to provide critical information for resource managers (specifically the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, henceforth BOEM, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, henceforth USFWS) about the spatial ecology, population status, and potential population threats to sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel, with particular reference to exposure to manmade structures and sources of oil and natural gas. Analysis of spatial monitoring data using a Bayesian-based synoptic model allowed for description of sea otter home ranges, identification of hot-spots of use, and insights into habitat selection behavior by male and female sea otters. Important findings included the deeper modal depth preferred by males versus females, strong preferences by both sexes for areas with persistent kelp canopy, and greater use of soft-sediment areas by males. The synoptic model also provided the ability to predict population-level density distribution for each sex in new habitats: by calculating the value of these probability density distributions at the known locations of natural seeps, we were able to identify those seeps with higher potential for sea otter encounters. The relative probability of occurrence at locations near to some seeps was sufficiently high (about 1% likelihood of occurrence for some of our study animals) that one would anticipate occasional encounters. Data on male and female survival, reproductive success, activity budgets, and body condition all indicated that sea otters in Santa Barbara Channel are not resource limited, and thus we would expect to see continued strong population growth in this area. However, the principal cause of death for study animals was lethal bites by white sharks, suggesting that shark bite mortality represents the single biggest threat to continued population growth in the Santa Barbara Channel.",No - double check with Ray,Shayna,,,NA,,,,,,J,"Al-Hilphy, Asaad R.; Al-Shatty, Sabah Malik; Al-Mtury, Atheer Abdul Amir; Gavahian, Mohsen",Solar Energy-assisted Extraction of Carp Fish Viscera Oil: New Sustainable Waste Valorization Platform,WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION,,,,,10.1007/s12649-023-02265-7,,2023,"PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the application of solar energy-based (SE) technology in extracting oil from common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) viscera as a fish processing waste, optimize this valorization process, and analyze the extracted oil.MethodsSE oils' physicochemical properties were analyzed and compared with conventional extraction (CE) oil. Also, an L-optimal response surface method (RSM) was used to optimize the process. Responses from daylight hours (independent factor) were the radiation intensity, ambient and viscera temperature, and heating efficiency. Besides, process waste was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to elaborate on extraction mechanisms.ResultsA new SE system was developed and valorized viscera to fish oil. This system was equipped with a perforated black cloth to protect extracted oil from the adverse effects of sun rays and impurities. The sunlight was absorbed, converted to thermal energy, and heated the waste through the conductive mode of heat transfer. Finally, oil and water were separated according to the relative density. The optimal system performance was achieved at a radiation intensity of 1100.2 W/m2, resulting in viscera temperature and heating efficiency of 81.2 celcius and 63.5%, respectively. The SE oil yield was 18.4% higher than CE. Also, SE oil had lower peroxide value, free fatty acid (FA), and thiobarbituric acid than CE by 40.9, 43.8, and 27.1%, respectively. The color of SE oil was more reddish (a*) and intense but less yellowish (b*) than CE. The half-life of SE oil was higher than CE (100 vs. 91 days). Besides, SE oil was rich in valuable unsaturated FA, including octadecenoic (35.1%), hexadecanoic (18.8%), and octadecadienoic acid (9.9%).ConclusionThe fish viscera waste was valorized to a valuable oil enriched in unsaturated health-promoting omega-3 and -6 FA.

This deforestation contributes to biodiversity loss, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, and damage to rural and indigenous livelihoods. Hundreds of articles have been published on the topic of deforestation across Amazonia, yet there has been no recent synthesis of deforestation drivers and deforestation-control policy effectiveness in the region. Here we undertook the first systematic review of papers published between 2000 and 2021 that have causally linked proximate and underlying drivers and policies to deforestation outcomes in Amazonia. In the 155 articles that met our inclusion criteria, we find that causal research is concentrated in Brazil, and to a lesser degree Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. There has been little study of the Guianas, Venezuela or Colombia. Large- and small-scale agriculture linked to improved market access and high agricultural prices are frequently researched underlying drivers of deforestation across the heavily researched regions. In the Guianas research focuses on mining with little focus on underlying causes. Research on infrastructure expansion, mining, and oil extraction and on technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors remains sparse. Many public and private policies have been found to be effective in controlling deforestation across the biome, with protected areas and public policies standing out as particularly successful in slowing deforestation vis-a-vis supply chain approaches. Frontier age, land tenure, and policy interactions are key moderating factors affecting the outcomes of different underlying causes and policies. Our findings indicate a greater need for research on (i) additional deforestation drivers beyond agriculture and economic factors, (ii) the complex interactions between different drivers and deforestation control policies, (iii) causes underlying deforestation in low or new deforestation areas, and (iv) the dynamics between Amazonian subregions and countries.

This paper calculates indirect energy consumption and CO(2)emissions by four energy sources (raw coal, crude oil, natural gas, and electricity), analyzes the energy structure, and conducts a structural decomposition analysis in urban and rural areas in China from 2002 to 2017. The results reveal that the indirect energy consumption and CO(2)emissions of urban households was 3.84 and 3.80 times, respectively, that of rural households in 2017 with most contributions from the 'Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery', 'Foods and Tobacco', and 'OTHERS' sectors. The energy consumption structure has changed. The percentage of coal consumption falls from 66.87% to 57.62%. Electricity consumption, ranked second, increased substantially from 10.77% to 22.90%. The key sectors of the energy mix have been found to help energy conservation. The high indirect energy consumption sectors with higher indirect energy intensity are the key sectors, especially the 'Processing of Petroleum, Coking and Processing of Nuclear Fuel' and 'Production and Supply of Electric Power and Heat Power'. The consumption structure effect is more obvious in urban areas than in rural areas. In the process of urbanization, its effect has little impact on urban indirect energy consumption. It implies that the focus is on optimizing consumption structure rather than reducing consumption scale.

This study provides an extensive review of the effects of oil development in relation to four interconnected themes: 1) the environment, including marine habitats and fish; 2) small-scale fisheries and coastal community livelihoods; 3) coastal and ocean spaces, including disputes over territory and infrastructure; and 4) ocean and coastal governance processes. We map spatial overlaps between the oil sector and small-scale fisheries and point to the frequent displacement of fishers from fishing grounds due to increasing coastal traffic and infrastructure, and the catastrophic effects of oil spills on fisheries and coastal economies. Though the oil sector generally has negative impacts on fisheries livelihoods and coastal communities, these effects and their mechanisms vary across locations, ecosystems, species, and specific activities and groups.

This has been documented in three regions that share a common feature, namely a wide and shallow continental shelf. This upwelling feature plays a key role in the ecology of the Canary Current System. It creates an innerfront which provides retention for biological material, e.g. fish eggs and larvae, in the highly productive nearshore environment.An analytical model has been developed based on a two dimensional extension of Ekman's Solution. The linear and steady response of a homogeneous Ocean forced by an upwelling-favorable wind provides a mechanism for the upwelling separation from the coast. The merging of the Surface and bottom Ekman layers induces a very weak cross-shore circulation and a kinematic barrier for the Ekman transport divergence. In the case of an alongshore wind, the barrier is located near the isobath h approximate to 0.4D, where D is the thickness of Ekman layers. This yields 1111 upwelling cell which is essentially concentrated in the region 0.5D < h < 1.25D, with upwelling occurring preferentially near the isobath h approximate to 0.6D. It turns out that the cross-shore width of upwelling scales with D/S, the ratio of Ekman depth to bottom topographic slope. The application of this solution to real bathymetric profiles rationalizes, not only the offshore upwelling observations in Northwest Africa, but also the influence of topography oil file cross-shelf structure of a wind-driven coastal upwelling. The model also quantifies the effect of the cross-shore wind component showing how it drives the nearshore pressure gradient adjustment and how it affects the upwelling. A linear numerical experiment reproduces the theoretical steady solution, thereby allowing investigation of the transient regime. Relaxation of the hypothesis in the numerical model validates the linear assumption of the theory and then allows investigation of the sensitivity to friction parameterizations and the influence of stratification. The latter leads to an oscillation of the upwelling cell with seaward migration driven by outcropping and homogeneization of the water column. and, coastal incursion driven by a boundary layers splitting process caused by shoreward advection of the isopycnal dome and stratification of the inner shelf.",No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Poddubnaya, Larisa G.; Scholz, Tomas; Kuchta, Roman; Levron, Celine; Gibson, David I.",Ultrastructure of the surface structures and secretory glands of the rosette attachment organ of Gyrocotyle urna (Cestoda: Gyrocotylidea),FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA,55,3,207,218,10.14411/fp.2008.028,Sep-08,2008,"The surface structures and gland cells of the posterior rosette organ of Gyrocotyle urna Grube et Wagener, I852, a member of the group presumed to be the most basal of the tapeworms (Cestoda: Gyrocotylidea), was studied by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy.

For surface waters in gas-exchange equilibrium with the atmosphere, models suggest increases in CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) from current values of ca. 390 mu atm to ca. 700-1,000 mu atm by the end of the century. However, in typically unequilibrated coastal hypoxic regions, much higher pCO(2) values can be expected, as heterotrophic degradation of organic material is necessarily related to the production of CO2 (i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon). Here, we provide data and estimates that, even under current conditions, maximum pCO(2) values of 1,700-3,200 mu atm can easily be reached when all oxygen is consumed at salinities between 35 and 20, respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of the carbonate system, the approximate doubling of seawater pCO(2) in surface waters due to ocean acidification will most strongly affect coastal hypoxic zones as pCO(2) during hypoxia will increase proportionally: we calculate maximum pCO(2) values of ca. 4,500 mu atm at a salinity of 20 (T = 10 A degrees C) and ca. 3,400 mu atm at a salinity of 35 (T = 10 A degrees C) when all oxygen is consumed. Upwelling processes can bring these CO2-enriched waters in contact with shallow water ecosystems and may then affect species performance there as well. We conclude that (1) combined stressor experiments (pCO(2) and pO(2)) are largely missing at the moment and that (2) coastal ocean acidification experimental designs need to be closely adjusted to carbonate system variability within the specific habitat. In general, the worldwide spread of coastal hypoxic zones also simultaneously is a spread of CO2-enriched zones.

At the same time, large portions of the Gulf of Mexico were closed to commercial and recreational fishing for most of the 2010 summer.

Abundances returned to levels similar to pre-DWH in 2012, 2013, and 2014.

We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely.

The low production from low permeability reservoirs prohibits many reservoirs from being economically producible. For those reservoirs to be considered for production, advanced production techniques are needed to increase the recovery rates. Previous research efforts concluded that utilizing advanced well structures and Carbon Dioxide based Water Alternating Gas (CO2 -WAG) injection are the most successful techniques to improve oil production from low permeability oil reservoirs. However, evaluating the implementation of a combination of those two production techniques to a low permeability reservoir is an expensive process due to the long run time needed to acquire the results using numerical simulation. Furthermore, optimization and history matching processes for these complicated production plans require more time and high computation power.In this study, we developed a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based toolbox (ANN-Based toolbox) to evaluate, optimize and history match the implementation of CO2 -WAG injection to a reservoir including a fish-bone structure producing well in low permeability oil reservoirs. The developed ANN-Based toolbox provides the results faster than the Numerical Simulation (few minutes compared to several hours) and requires lower computational power. This speed in acquiring the results helps to study more scenarios to optimize the production schemes.The ANN toolbox is developed to perform three tasks; production forecasting, production schemes design, and history matching. The production forecasting proxies are employed as a screening and forecasting toolbox to predict the time-based production rates for the reservoir under consideration when different production schemes are applied. The production schemes prediction proxies are employed to predict the production scheme that would fulfill desired production rates. Finally, the history matching proxy is developed to update the reservoir characteristics based on the production data. The developed proxies are validated using an extensive blind testing dataset, and the results of the testing dataset are presented to validate the capabilities of the developed toolbox. Furthermore, the developed toolbox was used to optimize a CO2 -WAG design scheme for a case study reservoir from Sirri A field.

Rumen fluid from goats (Taihang White cashmere goat, n = 6), sheep (Hu sheep, n = 6), and cows (Holstein cow, n = 6) was collected using oral intubation and immediately brought back to the laboratory for a fermentation test with the same total mixed ration (TMR) feed in vitro. The rumen bacterial composition was measured by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in the MiSeq platform, the gas production (GP) was recorded after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of fermentation, and the feed nutrient digestibility and the rumen fluid parameters were determined after 48 h of fermentation.

We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year.

An electrostatic field applicator was developed in the present work to reduce manual labor and pollen consumption in artificial date pollination. Labor saving was achieved by moving the system continuously, which requires a 2.5-m gap between the unit outlet and the tat-get, in order to avoid collisions with branches. Such a gap is in contrast with efficient electrostatic applications of dry matter since it dilutes the pollen cloud and reduces the space charge. A need to increase the velocity of the pollen-carrying air stream to overcome the prevailing wind also reduces the space charge.

The optimal operating parameters under 10.2 MPa and 323.15 K SCCO2 can attain the desired n-3/n-6 ratio in 6 h.

To enhance the solubility of n-3 PUFA in SCCO2, ethanol was applied as a co-solvent and reached an optimal input at 10 wt.% of total substrates.

All age classes of fish on 10 artificial and 16 natural reefs were censused along benthic and water-column transects during fall 1986. Physical characteristics of the reefs were measured and invertebrate and algal assemblages were assessed. Two types of artificial reefs were sampled. “Traditional” artificial reefs were usually small, isolated, completely submerged, and with low to moderate height. Breakwaters were larger, steeper, emergent (i.e., projected above the surface of the water) and tall. Natural reefs ranged from small, high-relief reefs composed of boulders and bedrock to extensive, low-relief reefs composed of cobbles. The mean size of artificial reefs was 2.66 ha, compared to 185 ha for natural reefs. Forty-one species of fish were sampled on the artificial and natural reefs. Artificial reefs had significantly more benthic fish species (x¯ = 18.7 vs. 14.2 for natural reefs), a greater density of benthic fishes (x¯ = 425/1,000 m3 vs. 185/1,000 m3 for natural reefs), and a greater biomass density of benthic fishes (x¯ = 30 kg/1,000 m3 vs. 22 kg/1,000 m3 for natural reefs); the diversity of benthic species was not different. The species richness, diversity, density and biomass density of fish in the water column were not different on artificial versus natural reefs. In general, the same species were found on both reef types, although the relative abundances of some of the common species differed. Nonetheless, the fish assemblages on artificial reefs were generally similar to the assemblages on natural reefs. Artificial reefs were so much smaller than most natural reefs that, in spite of their greater densities of fish, the total abundance of fish was generally much higher on natural reefs. Estimated standing stocks on artificial reefs varied from 0.12 to 2.77 metric tons (MT), with a mean of 0.94 MT. On natural reefs, estimated standing stocks varied from 2.08 to 276.05 MT, with a mean of 45.32 MT. This result has important implications for the use of artificial reefs in mitigation.

Habitat-based enhancements often deploy artificial reefs with the aim to increase the available structure to augment local production, yet current assessment approaches make it difficult to assess whether these reefs achieve pre-deployment goals. This makes it hard for managers to determine whether artificial reefs could improve their fishery outputs, potentially leading to missed opportunities and reduced production. We reviewed 270 research articles to determine whether existing monitoring studies identify whether artificial reefs meet their pre-deployment goals, thereby providing some evidence of their suitability for certain fisheries. We found only 62% of these studies clearly articulated the original goals of the reef. Goals were qualitative, and most studies were conducted over insufficient time frames to allow for ecological communities to stabilize and mature. It is therefore difficult to determine the success or failure of many artificial reefs in addressing the management issues for which they were deployed. In the light of these findings, we think the setting of explicit quantitative goals (which may be biological, social or economic), and monitoring the performance of reefs against these goals, could stimulate the broader application of artificial reefs in fisheries management strategies.

We tested the hypothesis that providing a spatial refuge for benthic fauna would result in elevated fish abundances on artificial reefs. Sturdy mesh bags that excluded fish predators and created a growth and reproductive refuge for fouling organisms were placed into artificial reef materials at four replicate sites off the North Carolina coast. Reef sites were subsequently surveyed using two methods: diver fish counts and professional angler success. Anglers consistently demonstrated greater catch rates on reefs with refuge bags. Diver surveys after one year also showed that total abundance of fish as well as abundance of several species was greater on experimental sites.

Both Ecopath models were divided into 18 functional groups from primary producers (algae and phytoplankton) and detritus to predatory species (e.g., Sebastes schlegelii). Model outputs showed that the ecosystem scale was smaller in the artificial reef (total system throughput (TPP) = 6,455.47 t center dot km(-2)center dot year(-1)) relative to its natural counterpart (TPP = 9,490.48 t center dot km(-2)center dot year(-1)).

Length frequency, mean biomass and frequency of occurrence of four fish genera targeted by local fisheries (Caranx, Haemulon, Lutjanus and Mycteroperca) were compared between two artificial and two natural reefs. Evidences of both production and attraction of target reef fishes by artificial reefs were found. Production is evidenced by the enormous abundance of recruits of a single grunt species, the tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum Cuvier). The high concentration of adults of predator demersal fishes (Mycteroperca spp. and Lutjanus spp.), present at low density on natural reefs, is the main evidence for attraction by artificial reefs. Results are inconclusive for the pelagic predators Caranx spp. The attraction that artificial reefs exert over large demersal predators can negatively affect nearby natural areas through shifts in predation, competition or nutrient input. Production can affect benthic communities in soft bottoms adjacent to artificial reefs by foraging of reef-associated fishes. Even when unplanned for fisheries purposes artificial reefs are often submitted to commercial and recreational fisheries and, due to the strong attraction they exert over large predators, these structures need harvest regulations.

Air exposure probably worsens the impact of high temperature on cultured sea cucumbers. In this present study, two laboratory experiments were designed to investigate the effects of artificial reefs on mortality, morbidity, crawling, feeding, and adhesion behaviors of small sea cucumbers (similar to 1 g of wet body weight) after air exposure and disease outbreaks at 25 degrees C, respectively. Significantly lower mortality and morbidity occurred in the group with artificial reefs compared with those in the group without artificial reefs in the two experiments. This present study found that the stressed sea cucumbers cultured inside artificial reefs showed a significantly higher adhesion index, feeding behavior, and crawling frequency than those cultured without artificial reefs. In disease challenge assays, small sea cucumbers cultured inside the artificial reefs showed a significantly higher adhesion index and crawling frequency than those cultured without artificial reefs at 25 degrees C. Feeding, crawling, and adhesion behaviors of sea cucumbers cultured outside artificial reefs were not significantly different from those cultured without artificial reefs. The experimental results indicate that sea cucumbers with good fitness-related behaviors may be less affected by the disease and more likely to move into the crevices of artificial reefs. Fitness-related behaviors were poor in sea cucumbers cultured outside artificial reefs, so we considered them as affected individuals. Thus, artificial reefs provide a place to reduce the physical contact between unaffected and diseased/affected individuals, showing a potential to reduce disease transmission.

To achieve this goal, marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OEABCMs) (Fisheries Act closures that meet Government of Canada criteria for OEABCMs) are being established. Many MPAs and OEABCMs have defined benthic conservation objectives. Defined benthic conservation objectives can include the protection of: benthic species (fish and invertebrates); benthic habitats including benthic spawning, nursery or feeding grounds; and Significant Benthic Areas, which include communities dominated by corals and/or sponges and hydrothermal vents, or locations likely to contain them such as canyons, seamounts, etc. By their nature, areas with defined benthic conservation objectives including MPAs and OEABCMs warrant a high(er) degree of risk aversion to anthropogenic activities than areas with no defined conservation objective. Oceans Management has requested national science advice on the effectiveness of existing mitigation measures in reducing the impacts of oil and gas exploration and production activities in Canadian waters, including seismic and drilling, on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives (such as MPAs and OEABCMs). Oceans Management sought this advice to inform policy related to oil and gas activities in areas with defined benthic conservation objectives. The advice may also be of interest to other sectors within Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), other federal departments, and oil and gas industry partners. Oil and gas operations and regulation The three main phases of marine based oil and gas activities are exploration, development and production, and decommissioning. The exploration phase may include electromagnetic and/or seismic surveys to identify potential oil and gas reservoirs, and drilling into formations (exploration drilling) to determine whether the identified reservoirs contain hydrocarbons. Following the determination that hydrocarbons are present in commercially-viable quantities, the development and production phase can begin. Development includes infrastructure planning and drilling of development wells, and production is the period during which a field and its associated pipelines (as applicable) and infrastructure are used to produce oil or gas. When the field is exhausted, the wells are plugged and abandoned, and production infrastructure is decommissioned. The lead regulators for offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities in Atlantic Canada are the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) and the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) which are joint federal-provincial agencies reporting to federal and provincial Ministers. Rights to explore for, develop and produce offshore petroleum resources are administered by these Boards in their respective jurisdictions and require environmental assessment under the respective legislation of the Boards and/or the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. Offshore oil and gas activities are also regulated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada under the Fisheries Act, Species at Risk Act and Oceans Act. For more information on oil and gas regulation please refer to the CNSOPB and C-NLOPB websites. The Arctic and Pacific Oceans are currently under moratoria for oil and gas exploration and development. Areas with defined benthic conservation objectives Areas with defined benthic conservation objectives refer to area-based management measures (such as MPAs and OEABCMs) applied to protect benthic components defined in conservation objectives. Defined benthic conservation objectives can include the protection of: benthic species (fish and invertebrates); benthic habitats including benthic spawning, nursery or feeding grounds; and Significant Benthic Areas, which include communities dominated by corals and/or sponges and hydrothermal vents, or locations likely to contain them such as canyons, seamounts, etc. The areas in question for this review are those where a higher vulnerability to anthropogenic activities can often be inferred, or where vulnerability has been explicitly identified. Therefore, a lower threshold of impact and a higher expectation of mitigation would be more appropriate. In addition, because the areas are subject to conservation objectives, a precautionary approach and ecosystem approach are recommended within these areas. Management of activities, including oil and gas exploration and production activities, within areas with defined benthic conservation objectives should, therefore, include a higher risk aversion than management of activities in areas without these objectives. Currently, beyond ensuring that infrastructure placement does not cause direct destruction of individual organisms/colonies in these areas, current oil and gas exploration and production management practices do not distinguish between areas with and without defined benthic conservation objectives in terms of the habitat-scale features and processes that they provide. SCOPE The objectives of the science peer review meeting were to provide advice on the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration and production on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives and to assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures in the Canadian context. A subset of activities related to oil and gas exploration and production was reviewed; including seismic surveys, controlled source electromagnetic surveys and geotechnical / geohazard surveys that may involve the placement of structures on the bottom or physical collection of bottom samples (cores/grabs), and drilling-related activities which may have direct or indirect impacts on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives. Other activities related to oil and gas exploration and production - in particular accidental events (e.g., chronic and catastrophic spills) - but also including decommissioning, and ancillary activities related to the oil and gas industry such as cable installation and boat traffic were not addressed. A recent review of oil spills was conducted by the Royal Society of Canada (Lee et al. 2015); however, this review did not examine oil spills in relation to areas with defined benthic conservation objectives (e.g., coral and sponge habitats). In addition, the current review focused on offshore activities, without explicitly addressing that impacts and mitigation measures are likely to be different between offshore and nearshore/estuarine environments, and will differ in Arctic environments. This evaluation reviewed the extent and significance of oil and gas exploration and production activities in areas with defined benthic conservation objectives in Canadian waters, and the existing mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. Maps depicting a snapshot of federal areas with defined benthic conservation objectives, locations of offshore petroleum licences, and call for bid areas (areas that are presently open for bids; these areas do not guarantee issuance of exploration licences) are provided for the Canadian Atlantic (Figure 2), Arctic (Figure 3), and Pacific Ocean (Figure 4).",No,Shayna,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Rouse, Sally; Porter, Joanne S.; Wilding, Thomas A.",Artificial reef design affects benthic secondary productivity and provision of functional habitat,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10,4,2122,2130,10.1002/ece3.6047,Feb-20,2020,"1. Novel hard substratum, introduced through offshore developments, can provide habitat for marine species and thereby function as an artificial reef. To predict the ecological consequences of deploying offshore infrastructure, and sustainably manage the installation of new structures, interactions between artificial reefs and marine ecosystem functions and services must be understood. This requires quantitative data on the relationships between secondary productivity and artificial reef design, across all trophic levels. Benthic secondary productivity is, however, one of the least studied processes on artificial reefs.2. In this study, we show that productivity rates of a common suspension feeder, Flustra foliacea (Linnaeus 1758), were 2.4 times higher on artificial reefs constructed from complex blocks than on reefs constructed from simple blocks, which had a smaller surface area.3. Productivity rates were highest on external areas of reefs. Productivity rates decreased by 1.56%, per cm distance into the reef on complex reefs and 2.93% per cm into the reef on simple block reefs. The differences in productivity rates between reefs constructed from simple and complex blocks are assumed to reflect different current regimes and food supply between the external and internal reef areas, according to reef type.4. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that artificial reef design can affect secondary productivity at low trophic levels. We demonstrate that the incorporation of voids into reef blocks can lead to a greater proportion of the structure serving as functional habitat for benthic species.

This study was conducted on the coral and other fouling organisms of two accidental artificial reefs (40 to 70 year-old shipwrecks) in Cyprus (Levantine Sea).

Attraction and/or production by a particular artificial reef is predicted to depend on the species and individual ages (size) of reef fish, and on reef location. Factors predicted to be important are natural reef availability, mechanisms of natural population limitation, fishery exploitation pressure, life history dependency on reefs, and species-specific and age-specific behavioral characteristics. Increased production is most likely at locations isolated from natural reefs, and for habitat-limited, demersal, philopatric, territorial, and obligatory reef species.

Approximately two-thirds of all reef angling trips took place nearshore in state-managed waters, and 70% of trips that utilized artificial reefs occurred in this area. Regionally, the highest proportion of angler trips targeting reef-associated species on artificial reefs took place in the panhandle of Florida, where Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus are most abundant.

Each operation of immersion poses specifics problems (technical and practical) and requires obtaining prior administrative authorization, usually very stringent.The marine environment is protected by the basic principles of public domain; any form of private occupation or use remains systematically temporary, precarious and revocable.This first aspect is essential in the case of artificial reefs, in which immersion and productive potential are registered over the long term, without any real vocation to be removed from the seabed once their term expired. The administration is still very reserved about the perennity of artificial reefs, a concept against the classic rules in practice for the management of the public domain.The second aspect lies in the arrangements concerning the exploitation of artificial reefs. Purely private access and use of artificial reefs seem irrelevant, given the potential conflicts they generate and the physical and legal impossibility of recognizing a form of private property of the species they house.

In this study, we developed trophic models for the established artificial oyster reef (EAOR), newly deployed artificial oyster reef (NAOR), and non-reef bare substratum (NBS) ecosystems located in the Bay of Xiangyun, Bohai Sea, China, to assess the benefits of artificial oyster reef construction and to characterize the unique role of these reefs in coastal management. The analysis showed that the EAOR and NAOR ecosystems were similar to each other, but both were greatly different than the NBS ecosystem. Reefs showed greater ecological size and stronger top-down effects compared to the bare area. The ecosystems were not yet mature, but the EAOR and NAOR ecosystems had more complicated trophic relationships, greater potential to withstand perturbations, and higher biological carrying capacities of commercial organisms compared to the NBS ecosystem. These results demonstrated that artificial oyster reef construction resulted in great advantages to the ecosystem. For example, oysters became the structuring functional group and played a critical role in the trophic structure of the reef areas. The phytoplankton/detritus-oysters-carnivorous macrobenthos pathway developed and became dominant in these areas, thereby contributing to highly efficient secondary production. The ratios of total primary production/total respiration were < 1, indicating that the reef ecosystems responded effectively to nutrient inputs from adjacent ecosystems. We speculate that water exchange might be a critical factor influencing the maintenance of the system. Long-term monitoring of the EAOR and NAOR should be implemented for oyster protection and to assess the need to manipulate carnivorous macrobenthos to keep the systems in balance.

Species richness on the Caledonie Toho 2 increased to reach 42 species 398 days after scuttling. Fish density increased for 109 days after scuttling to reach a mean of 8.15 fish/m2, with exceptional peaks during recruitment phases. Fish biomass increased in two steps to reach an average of 336 g/m2 193 days after scuttling.

Ricaudy fish assemblages were characterized by species associated with live corals whereas the artificial reefs were characterized by pelagic and opportunist species. Differences occurred between the Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage, characterized by numerous sciophylous species (Apogonidae), and the Caissons assemblage, characterized by large carnivorous species (Serranidae, Lutjanidae). These differences were due to the different size, shape and age of the two artificial reefs. The Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage evolved from a pioneer to a secondary assemblage, with four species assemblages being successively identified. The first step of the colonization was the arrival of large fish from the Caissons and the recruitment of Chromis fumea (Pomacentridae). The other species assemblages were characterized by seasonal recruitment of juveniles and migration of pelagic and opportunist adult fish species. The secondary assemblage was characterized by an increasing migration of adults of specialized benthic species despite the persistence of a pool of pelagic and opportunist species.

Small coral reef fishes are ideal study subjects because redistribution is most likely during the larval stage, given limited dispersal of benthic stages. We develop a model that incorporates the simultaneous effects of habitat augmentation, competition among reefs for larval settlers, and post-settlement density-dependence, and propose two experimental approaches for evaluating the effects of artificial reefs on local production of natural reefs. One is based on small-scale studies using replicated patch reefs, the other on unreplicated studies using larger reefs and the Before-After-Control-Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design.

While the underlying mechanisms remain widely debated, production was recently determined as the most probable cause of increases in fish biomass. Changes in fish biomass in a temperate AR system were investigated from December 2008 to November 2015 by considering seven distinct functional groups, and isotopic functional indices were used to identify how these changes may have affected organic matter (OM) fluxes. Contrasting patterns of change were observed between functional trophic groups, highlighting that combining the biomass of all species present in a community is inappropriate for assessing AR-induced effects. Benthic sedentary species pre-dominated (> 75% of the total biomass) through massive production, with a 68-fold increase in mean biomass over the study period. Mobile species tended to vary seasonally, suggesting only a slight influence of AR. Zooplanktivores biomass decreased over the 6-year period, as a possible result of changes in environmental conditions. Isotopic indices helped to reveal both the community maturation and the importance of local OM sources not only in supporting fish biomass production but also in attracting pelagic species. Our results corroborate that production and attraction are two extremes of a range of contrasting patterns and highlight the importance of considering the specific responses of functional components of fish communities to accurately describe changes in AR functioning.

An important factor influencing the success of artificial reefs may be the provision of refuge for zooplanktivorous fishes, which use artificial reefs as a base to forage the surrounding zooplankton. A numerical model was developed to quantify this trophic pathway on a designed coastal artificial reef, using field-parameterised data for zooplankton biomass, current velocity, and the consumption rate and abundance of a reef-resident zooplanktivorous fish (Atypichthys strigatus). The model estimated that this species consumed similar to 2.9 kg (1.0 g m(-3)) of zooplankton per day on this artificial reef, which represents only 0.35% of the total zooplankton biomass. The ability of this artificial reef to support similar to 130 kg standing stock of this species suggests that the zooplankton pathway is a reliable mechanism for fish production. A second model explored the influence of reef size on zooplanktivorous fish densities and the supply of zooplankton required to sustain their consumption rate. As reef size increased, the ratio between the foraging volume and refuge volume declined, meaning that small reefs have lots of food and not much refuge, and large reefs can have lots of refuge but not enough food. This indicates that reef size can be manipulated to maximise fish abundance while avoiding food limitation. Reef size, shape, and orientation should be considered carefully during the planning of artificial reefs, as it can greatly influence the foraging of reef-resident zooplanktivorous fishes and thus influence the entire reef assemblage.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Arena, P.

During the same intervals, fish assemblages at neighboring natural reefs were also censused. A total of 114,252 fishes of 177 species was counted on natural and vessel-reefs combined. Mean fish abundance and biomass were significantly greater on vessel-reefs in comparison to surrounding natural reef areas.

Both mean fish abundance and mean species richness were not significantly different between natural reefs neighboring vessel-reefs and natural reefs with no artificial structures nearby. This suggests the vessel-reefs are not, in general, attracting fish away from neighboring natural reefs in our area. Additionally, economically important fish species seem to prefer vessel-reefs, as there was a greater abundance of these species on vessel-reefs than surrounding natural reef areas. Fish assemblage structure on natural versus artificial reefs exhibited a low similarity (25.8%). Although no one species was responsible for more than 6% of the total dissimilarity, fish assemblage trophic structure differed strikingly between the two reef types.

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes.

The results of this survey were compared to a more limited survey conducted circa 1970 and to earlier, less detailed accounts. Our survey approximately doubles the known area of reef and unconsolidated shelly substrate in the bay system.Certain components of the Galveston Bay reef system have persisted throughout recorded time; others have exhibited substantial malleability, changing position and shape in response to natural and man-made changes in the bay system. Regional subsidence has resulted in an increase in water depth over the reefs, thus reducing the acreage intertidally and subaerially exposed, and areas of high subsidence have suffered reef attrition due to siltation. Channelization, dike construction, and the disappearance of major barrier reef have substantially changed bay circulation patterns. As a consequence, the equilibrium that once existed between the reefs and bay circulation has been modified, resulting in loss or attrition of a number of reefs in areas of lowered salinity and the accretion of reefs parallel to the new isohaline structure of the bay. Thus, some reefs are no longer optimally located for continued high productivity; many areas of low reef coverage would now support productive reef if substrate became available. In optimal areas, reefs more than doubled in size in 20 yr.No evidence was found to suggest that the oyster fishery had contributed to reef attrition, however leasing may have encouraged reef accretion. Artificial reefs did no worse or better than their natural nearby counterparts, indicating siting as the overriding concern for successful artificial reef emplacement.

These communities were sampled extensively and compared to analogous communities at an older artificial reef and a natural reef in the region. Sampling was designed to document potential differences due to time since construction, height above the ocean bottom, season, location within reef (e.g., current and edge effects), and sporadic disturbances. Questions about the speed and pattern of development of turf communities are important because of their role in providing habitat and food for both resident and transient fish populations. Multivariate analyses, which are more sensitive than species-by-species approaches, were used to describe and compare temporal and spatial patterns. These analyses showed a typical successional pattern at PAR in which the turf community became progressively more similar to that at older reefs over time. At PAR, species groups dominated by a mud ectoproct, barnacles, algal turf, hydroids, erect ectoprocts and Rhodymenia spp. were steadily replaced by species groups characterized by the scaled worm mollusk, the ornate jewel box, and gorgonians over the period of the study.

We tested the effect of sampling location (artificial, first, and second reef), general feeding strategy (herbivore, omnivore, invertivore, and carnivore), phylogeny, and standard length on delta C-13 and d15N. The reef fish communities of the artificial and natural reef tracts were significantly different; the artificial sites also exhibited more variability. For all samples, delta C-13 and delta N-15 ranged from -19.5 to -13.1% and 6.7-13.3%, respectively. Significant effects were detected for both general feeding strategy and phylogeny. Significant differences were also seen in delta C-13 and delta N-15 profiles between artificial and natural reefs; however, these changes were primarily driven by differences in fish community structure, rather than by changes in the feeding strategy or trophic relationships of individual fish taxa. The trophic guild invertivore was the only group of fish to demonstrate significant isotopic differences between both reef tracts (inner and outer) and reef types (artificial and natural). The artificial reef may act more as a foraging corridor between the natural first and second reef tracts for omnivores and carnivores.

Theoretically, the performance of the artificial reef could be firmly related to the designed shape of the reef itself and aquatic environment. Consequently, the flow phenomenon surrounding the artificial reefs and the related study of fish-attracting factors often draw the attention of marine ecologists and engineers. Knowledge about the flow pattern around the reefs can be obtained from different sources such as field observation, model experiment and numerical simulation. However, the performance analysis of artificial reefs by means of the field observation and experimental approach could cost much expenditure during the research. Moreover, the interference from the imbedded experimental facility could always be the key issue to spoil the accurate recordings for the flow mechanisms inside the reefs. Therefore, when comparing these methods, the numerical technique which could provide an efficient way and avoid such bothersome problems has been regarded as an economical tool in this research topic. The finite volume numerical method with a well-valid k-epsilon model has been employed to fulfill the artificial-reef flow simulation in this paper.

In particular, we experimentally analysed the sequence of colonisation of macrobenthic communities of the Ancao artificial reef system, which was deployed in the summer of 2002. The study of the colonisation of benthic communities was done using samples of concrete cubic units (15 x 15 cm) that were suspended at the reef modules at a depth of 20 m, at the time of the reef immersion. Four replicate samples were collected by SCUBA diving from two groups of the Ancao reef every three months from the starting date. Sampling was done using essentially non-destructive methods to assess the percentage cover of macrobenthic organisms in both vertical and horizontal surfaces. The percentage cover of the taxonomic groups was compared within the different surfaces of the samples and between the two reef groups. The bottom surface of cubic samples had a significantly higher colonisation related to the dominance of barnacle cover, probably due to lower sedimentation levels. Samples from both reef groups showed a similar pattern of colonisation. Barnacles, bryozoans and serpulids dominated the samples three months immediately after the beginning of the experiment.

Specifically, we analyzed recordings from 5 week-long hydrophone deployments on 2 natural rocky reefs and 2 artificial reefs on the North Carolina, USA, continental shelf. Analysis of sound pressure levels (SPLs) on hourly and seasonal scales revealed similar temporal patterns between the reef types. These patterns were largely driven by 4 dominant fish vocalizers with seasonal chorusing patterns, including a toadfish Opsanus sp. Despite similar temporal patterns within reef types, soundscape spectral content was more similar within than between reef types, especially during the April deployment, which had the most acoustic activity. Our findings suggest that the soundscapes of shipwreck artificial reefs may differ from the soundscapes of natural rocky reefs, possibly due to differing community composition.

Phytoplankton abundance and community structure can reflect the change of conditions of marine environment and they influence organisms at high trophic level (e. g. fish) through a bottom-up control mechanism. The water around Lidao had a healthy ecosystem and abundant fisheries resources for a long time, while environmental deterioration and over-fishing put much pressure upon this ecosystem in recent years. According to the previously reported studies, artificial reefs were considered as effective methods of repairing marine ecological system by providing shelter for fishery resources, restricting the harvest of destructive fishing gears (e. g. trawl) and altering the flow distribution. Therefore, the local government conducted an artificial reef construction project from the year of 2005 in order to improve the marine environment and recovery fisheries resources in this area. The previous studies on estimating the multiplication of artificial reef mostly focused on nekton and seldom reported the effect of artificial reef on phytoplankton. In this study, we used multivariate statistical analysis to compare the parameters of phytoplankton community at different times (four seasons) and locations (artificial and control areas) to assess the status of primary productivity in this region after carrying out an artificial reef project.

The main dominant species were Licmophora abbreviate, Paralia sulcata, Coscinodiscus asteromphalus among others. Paralia sulcata was the predominant species in spring, autumn and winter. Dominant species and phytoplankton community structure varied among seasons significantly, but they did not change between artificial and control area.

Water column primary productivity, chl-a, and biomass were also measured to assess the contribution of phytoplankton to total net primary production at these four sites.

The data for this study was obtained from interviews with 290 artisanal fishers from three districts of Terengganu, using a structured questionnaire. The study found that for fishers, income from fishing was significantly lower in AR areas, compared to non-AR areas. The income of the fishers who used drift nets as their main fishing gear was significantly lower in AR areas. This indicates that income from fishing was not attributable to the AR programme in Malaysia. The results suggest that artificial reefs may not be effective at increasing catch and income for artisanal fishers in Terengganu. Furthermore, the larger-engined boats gained substantial fishing income, which seems to reflect unequal distribution of benefits, because only those who could invest in fishing equipment and who spent more on fishing operations were able to gain maximum benefits. The results suggest that the current use of multiple gear in the same fishing locations created conflicts between various groups of fishers, and increased fishing costs. These conflicts could be reduced if the artificial reef locations are clearly marked and they established user rights among various fisher groups.

Nowadays, most of the reefs are located off the Mediterranean coast; new projects are being developed on the Atlantic side (e.g. Yeu Island or Cap Breton, etc.), the English Channel (Le Treport), and the overseas' islands of Reunion and Martinique.Thus, approximately 40 reef sets have been submerged in French marine waters; some of them are the result of several releases (e.g., Gruissan, Marine Park of the Blue Coast (Charbonnel et al. 2000)). These projects are most often created at the request of fishermen working close to the coasts. The development of the artificial reef was initially connected to development and support for inshore fishing (creation of the site in 1968 in Palavas, unpublished Lacroix D.). Currently in France, artificial reefs are linked to production and protection issues (Pary 2004; Claudet 2006).This summary of the French experience in artificial reefs describes both the quantitative approach (sites, volume, design) and recent project costs (since 2000).",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Holland, Matthew M.; Becker, Alistair; Smith, James A.; Everett, Jason D.; Suthers, Iain M.",Fine-scale spatial and diel dynamics of zooplanktivorous fish on temperate rocky and artificial reefs,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,674,,221,239,10.3354/meps13831,Sep 16 2021,2021,"Plankton is an important component of the food web in coastal reef ecosystems. Ocean currents subsidise local production by supplying plankton to resident and reef-associated plank-tivorous fishes. Measuring the fine-scale distribution of these schooling fishes provides insight into their habitat use and how they balance risk and reward while foraging for plankton. Maintaining their proximity to benthic structure can provide refuge from predation but may also limit foraging opportunities. We used a portable multibeam echosounder to survey schooling fish at 5 natural and 3 artificial reefs, during day and night and under different current conditions. We isolated midwater acoustic targets and used generalised linear models to explain the distribution of schools as a function of current exposure, distance from structure and seafloor complexity. We also isolated individual schools and used generalised least squares to model how school characteristics differed between night and day, using spatial metrics of school area, perimeter length and height above the seafloor. Modelling revealed that the occurrence of schools was almost twice as likely upstream versus downstream of artificial reefs, although distance to reef structure was the main influence. School occurrence was also more likely on artificial versus natural reefs. Schools at artificial reefs exhibited greater volume and areal coverage at night, and during the day they rose higher in the water column while aggregating more closely around the reef.

Here we provide a novel perspective on this issue, specifically regarding the nutrient dynamics of biogeochemical hotspots that develop following artificial reef construction. Fishes can translocate nutrients (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) from the surrounding seascape and concentrate them around artificial reefs, often increasing localized primary production. We discuss an example of this in a seagrass ecosystem, using a case study demonstrating the specific mechanism by which aboveground primary production is enhanced. Namely, when nutrient supply exceeds an ecological threshold, non-linear shifts in nutrient allocation occurs to aboveground tissues, serving to increase localized primary production. Identifying such ecological thresholds in resource allocation provides a powerful predictive tool in the context of fishery management. We suggest that such an ecosystem-level perspective should become more prominent in discussions regarding the attraction-production question of artificial reefs. (C) 2016 Elseiver B.V.

An experimental campaign was carried out in order to simulate the influence that M-Type unit reef groups may have on the local flow field and the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique has been implemented to provide velocity maps. The results showed that with the increase of velocity's current approaching the artificial reef, the height, length and area of the upwelling and the back vortex rise with the increase of spacing between the artificial reefs. Furthermore, when comparing different geometrical configurations with similar currents approaching the artificial reef, the maximum values of both upwelling and back vortex were obtained when the spacing between unit reefs was 1.25 L. Finally, the entropy method was used to evaluate the effects on the flow field under four kinds of spacing based on the hydrodynamic characteristics and the economic cost. The comprehensive score obtained for all the configurations followed the order 1.25 L > 1.50 L > 0.75 L > 1.00 L. Therefore, it is suggested that the original design spacing should be increased by 25% when the M-type unit reef is put into practice. Additionally, after having completed a comparative analysis, it is recommended to further change the reef group into four reef monocases. By executing this adjustment, the unit reef cost was reduced by 10%, and the influence range on the flow field increased by 10%, and this result can consequently achieve greater ecological benefits with less economic input.

Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different scour protections in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations.

We estimate the quantitative enhancement of fish production under 4 plausible scenarios: attraction, enhancement, enhancement with fishing, and attraction with fishing. Our intent is not to resolve the attraction-enhancement debate, but to quantify the uncertainty associated with using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation. Pertinent parameters for production calculations (fish density by size class, length-frequency distributions, diets, behaviors, age-specific growth and mortality rates) were obtained from syntheses of findings from artificial reef studies conducted in coastal waters of the southeastern USA and from species life-history profiles. Year-round reef inhabitants were separated into 2 groups: those whose recruitment appears to be limited by available reef habitat (only 2 taxa) and those not augmented in recruitment but potentially enhanced in realized production by provision of refuges and reef-associated prey (15 taxa). Estimates of enhanced production in this latter group were discounted by an index of reef exclusivity in diet to give production credit in proportion to consumption of reef-associated prey. Estimates of annual production enhancement per 10 m(2) of artificial reef ranged from 0 kg under the attraction scenario to 6.45 kg wet weight under the assumption of enhancement plus protection from fishing. Application of fishing reduced the enhancement estimate by 32 % to 4.44 kg 10 m(-2) yr(-1). A 4th scenario of attraction with fishing may yield a net decline in production of a similar magnitude. In contrast to many natural structural habitats (seagrass meadows, oyster reefs, salt marshes, mangroves) that have dramatically decreased over past decades and are clearly important nursery grounds, evidence is weak that habitat provided by artificial reefs on the shallow continental shelf of the southeastern USA is currently limiting to fish production. Until convincing empirical evidence appears, high scientific uncertainty limits confidence in using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation.

In this chapter we describe the steps or stages involved in this governmental program necessary for building artificial reefs to help induce upwelling.

Scientifically, they are used increasingly as platforms for rigorous ecological experimentation. Historically, a case has been made that at least some artificial reef technologies have not been grounded upon sound principles, and that their utilization can harm fish populations and the environment. Can artificial reef deployments, and their associated body of technical knowledge, be considered as established practices and components in fishery science? What is the appropriate role and scope for them in marine ecosystem management? While these questions are debated, advances in the science and applications of this technology nevertheless continue. This chapter concludes that this relatively young field does add value to environmental science and management.Our understanding of artificial reefs needs to be informed by theory and empirical evidence, and this paper adopts both approaches. Bioeconomics provides a frame of reference for analyzing the circumstances in which reef deployment will generate sustainable economic benefits, and gives a theoretical context for the examples that follow. Case studies illustrate a sustained -community-based fishery in Portugal, attainment of resource protection and allocation objectives in Italy, success in designing a reef to create habitat for kelp in the United States, and incorporation of reefs into marine ranching in Korea, all at relatively large scales. Together, these findings illustrate shared attributes and trends concerning study and deployment of artificial reefs, which may unify, guide, and foster future investigations and management in various branches of aquatic sciences. For example:Sustainability of resource utilization is a standard concern that sets reefs in a broader social and environmental context.Maintaining or enhancing biodiversity is a common goal that extends reef objectives beyond exploitation.Engaging a broad variety of community stakeholders enhances reef development and assessment efforts.Using artificial reefs as sites for manipulative experiments affords study designs that could not be conducted at natural habitats.Promoting multidisciplinary studies offers a powerful approach for addressing complex environmental issues.Adaptation of fundamental knowledge of species life history requirements to the design of physical structure of reefs combines basic research with the interests of society for applications.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Pourjomeh, Fatemeh; Shokri, Mohammad Reza; Kiabi, Bahram",Do Cement Boulders Mimic Natural Boulders for Macro-Invertebrates in the Southern Caspian Sea?,TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,14,1,155,164,10.4194/1303-2712-v14_1_17,Mar-14,2014,"The macro-invertebrates on natural (rock) and artificial (cement) boulders were compared along the southern Caspian Sea and the effect of structural features of boulders (i.e. orientation, facing, surface complexity, the degree of exposure to the wave action) on macro-invertebrate communities were investigated.

For this study, the trophic model of the Sea of Oman's artificial reef ecosystem was described using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) ecosystem modeling software (Version 6.6.7). The essential characteristics of the aquatic system were identified using a total of 38 fish species/functional groups, spread across an area of 140 km2 of artificial reef farm. The mean trophic level of the artificial reef ecosystem of the Sea of Oman was 3.039. Sharks were the keystone species of the studied ecosystem. Heniochus acuminatus and Chaetodon gardneri were the species with the highest niche overlap, whereas Acanthurus sohal and other crustaceans, and Terapon puta and Saurida undosquamis were the species with the lowest niche overlap. It was found that the ratio of total primary production to total respiration of the ecosystem studied was more than one, indicating that the system produces more energy than it uses to respire, and the ecosystem of the Sea of Oman can be regarded as a developing system because of its low degree of stability and maturity.

However, human impacts can influence the effects of consumer-mediated nutrients in two main ways: (1) overfishing can reduce consumer populations and thus the nutrients they supply, (2) anthropogenic nutrient enrichment can shift baselines of nutrient limitation. Previous work has shown that artificial reefs create biogeochemical hot spots from which nutrient responses by surrounding primary producers can be measured. We constructed eight artificial reefs from 88 cinder blocks in shallow seagrass beds near Ile-a-Vache, Haiti, to test for interacting effects of fish-mediated nutrients and anthropogenic nutrients on growth rates of the dominant seagrass, Thalassia testudinum, surrounding the artificial reefs. We found that (1) anthropogenic nutrient enrichment appears to be the primary factor influencing seagrass growth close to the artificial reef, and (2) despite overall anthropogenic nutrient enrichment effects, consumer-mediated nutrients still generate biogeochemical hot spots and the two nutrient sources additively influence seagrass growth rates. We also found that nitrogen and phosphorus similarly predict seagrass growth rates, and better so than their ratio, indicating the supply rates of nitrogen and phosphorus are both limiting seagrass production. Results from this study indicate that the effect of anthropogenic nutrients can strongly influence seagrass growth in these systems, but consumers can supply a source of nutrients that has additive effects on seagrass growth.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Kim,, Ho-Sang; 박해훈; 신종근; 김재오; 박승윤; 임동현; 박영철; 조성환; 홍승현; 이정우; 안병길",An Effect on Fisheries Resources Enhancement of Hollow Jumbo Structure and a Search for Artificial Reefs by Side Scan Sonar in the Western Sea of Korea,Journal of the Korean Society of Fisheries and Ocean Technology,39,3,230,238,,2003,2003,"An effect on the enhancing production of hollow 'jumbo' structures and the condition of artificial reefs (dice and hollow jumbo structure) by side scan sonar were described.

These reefs are well-studied from a direct fisheries-based perspective, drawing largely on traditional theory and methodological approaches from population and community ecology. Here we provide an alternative perspective using basic tenets of ecosystem ecology. We focus largely on primary production, as this ecosystem process necessarily constrains the secondary production of fish and invertebrates. We use this ecosystem ecology viewpoint to examine the long-standing attraction/production question-do artificial reefs support 'new' fish production or simply attract individuals from other habitats? Central to this discussion is identifying ecological thresholds and self-reinforcing feedbacks. For example, biological or physical processes may facilitate reaching nutrient supply thresholds where fundamental ecological dynamics are shifted, such as enhanced seagrass allocation of resources to above-ground plant structures following aggregation of fish around reefs. Synthesis and applications. We propose that the scope for enhanced primary productivity (or other accelerated ecosystem processes) is an under-utilized guideline that can be used to prioritize artificial reef deployment as part of broader coastal management programmes.

Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomato-pods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta S-34) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher delta S-34 values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche.

Artificial reefs supported a diverse, abundant, and dynamic assemblage of fishes that were a mixture of species found in surrounding sand and natural reef habitats. Colonization (number of species, individuals, and biomass) was very rapid. Abundance varied seasonally with recruitment episodes tending to occur in the spring and summer followed by losses for the remainder of the year. Assemblages were quite variable on and between similar sized reefs. Fish and biomass densities were higher at artificial reefs than on sand and natural reefs. Resident fish biomass varied less than resident fish numbers, because individual growth compensated for mortality after recruitment episodes. Reef size significantly influenced total numbers of species, individuals, and biomass. Smaller reefs had greater fish density while larger reefs had higher biomass density from larger but fewer, individuals. Multiple small reefs supported more individuals and more species than one large reef of equal material. Fishes recruited by larval settlement accounted far 36% of the total resident abundance but only 2% of total biomass. As reef size increased, older juvenile or adult colonists comprised a greater percentage of total biomass (94% to 99%). Assemblage importance percentages (based on abundance, biomass, and frequency) were divided between residents (64%), visitors (20%), and transients (16%). Economically important species comprised 61% of the biomass and 55% of the individuals, among which settlers accounted for 94.3% of individuals but only 5.7% of their total biomass. The most highly valued species were visitors or residents that utilized the reefs after first settling elsewhere. These results showed that data on artificial reef assemblages based solely on the abundance of resident species are biased.

Inappropriate experimental designs have prevented many studies from discriminating between the two processes. Eight of 11 experiments comparing fish abundances on artificial reefs with those on adjacent soft bottom habitats were compromised by a lack of replication or spatial interspersion in the design itself. Only three studies featured proper controls and replicated designs with the interspersion of reef and control sites. Goodness of fit tests of abundance data for 67 species from these studies indicated that more fishes occur on reefs than on controls, particularly for species that typically occur over hard substrata. Conversely, seagrass specialists favour controls over reefs. Changes in the appearance of fish abundance trajectories driven by manipulation of sampling intervals highlight the need for adequate temporal sampling to encompass key life history events, particularly juvenile settlement. To ultimately determine whether attraction and production is responsible for increased abundances on reefs, requires two experimental features: 1) control sites, both interspersed among artificial reefs and at reef and non-reef locations outside the test area and 2) incorporation of fish age and length data over time.

Fish visual censuses were done by SCUBA, monthly, since October of 2002 to September of 2003 in both sites. The pattern of species succession in each block was characterized by cumulated curves of species in the time long, and the curves calibrated by the minimum squares and the angular coefficient founded for each one of the sites compared by the Student Test. A Total of 23 species was identified for RD and 8 to RF. The increasing number of species, measured by the angular coefficient of each equation, was significant different (tcal(b1-b2) =4,474; p<<0,01) and superior in the block near the rocky shore (bRD=1,503; bRF=0,682). Different raising pattern in the species number could be verified when compare the both succession curves, RF showed two distinct pulses. In RD the raising number of species also was verified however this raise was more gradual and continual. The results indicated that the proximity to other natural subtract act directly on the colonization process by fishes in artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Coll, Josep; Abad, Raquel; Alvarez, Elvira; Deudero, Salud; Mas, Ramon; Riera, Francesc; Moreno, Isabel",STATE OF FISH POPULATIONS AND INFLUENCE ON THE TRAMMEL NET FISHERY AT THREE BALEARIC ISLAND (WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN) ARTIFICIAL REEFS A DECADE AFTER THEIR DEPLOYMENT,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,85,1,77,100,,Jul-09,2009,"Aggregation/production artificial reefs (ARs) were first deployed in the Balearic Islands in the early 1990s. Early studies concluded that these ARs concentrated medium-and large-sized commercial fish, a fact that could lead to a risk of overfishing in the area. A decade after their deployment, the same ARs were re-examined using experimental fishing and visual censuses. Results from our study demonstrated that the Balearic ARs have not increased the risk of overfishing because fishing effort on them is moderate, trammel net efficiency on ARs is low, there are high immigration rates to the ARs, and there are natural areas with a medium-high seabed relief that hold reserve stocks that are larger than those found on the ARs. Likewise, we found that the overall condition of the ecosystem is more important for the characterization of the composition and yield of AR catches than are the eutrophic-oligotrophic conditions of the surrounding water masses. We note that the function of the aggregation/production ARs is only analogous to that of marine protected areas (MPAs) and that ARs therefore should always be managed to ensure the correct use of marine resources.

Large patches with dense kelp supported the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity of fishes, with the addition of dense kelp tripling biomass and doubling richness. The abundance of recruits in artificial collectors declined with patch size and was halved on reefs with sparse kelp compared to reefs with dense kelp or no kelp.

A total of 12 families and 14 species were identified, expanding the total species list in the area by eight species and three families.

For free-living fish and motile invertebrates, the natural mortality rate often descends steeply with size and age toward maturity, but from simple simulations, the fractal properties of structurally complex marine habitats suggest that mortality rates may rise again for older, crevice-dependent fishes. That natural cover for commercial-sized organisms is limited can be inferred from the rapid colonization of artificial reefs. Estimating hole-size availability in the local environment could be important in optimizing crevice sizes prior to installing artificial reefs.For shelter-dependent animals, competition for the progressively fewer large crevices predicted by fractal theory will inevitably increase, given longer residence times for older fishes. This may lead to migration or a rise in predation mortality, and eventually lead to a production bottleneck for larger fishes. This could explain the effectiveness of large-scale deployment of artificial reefs with large crevice sizes, but also the potential they have for overexploitation if access to artificial reefs by fishers is not controlled. Nonetheless, installing artificial reefs within reserves, with crevice sizes adjusted for the dimensions of mature fishes, could help compensate for natural habitat deficiencies and create spawning refugia supplying recruits to adjacent areas.The possibility of production bottlenecks was investigated, reanalyzing size-frequency data from an unfished population, and applying a new method of checking size frequencies based on fractal theory that calculates the scaling coefficient Q, which is the rate of decline in log numbers with size. This procedure helps identify bottlenecks in habitat availability, judging from the intersection of quasi-linear segments of log-size frequency plots. Size-frequency data for an unexploited reef area suggest that, for some smaller reef fishes, trends in log numbers at size may reflect fractal expectation (Mandelbrot, 1983). For larger specimens, steep declines in numbers at size suggest that cover was limited, and predation or migration were occurring well before the maximum size for the species was reached.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Glarou, Maria; Zrust, Martina; Svendsen, Jon C.",Using Artificial-Reef Knowledge to Enhance the Ecological Function of Offshore Wind Turbine Foundations: Implications for Fish Abundance and Diversity,JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,8,5,,,10.3390/jmse8050332,May-20,2020,"As the development of large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) amplifies due to technological progress and a growing demand for renewable energy, associated footprints on the seabed are becoming increasingly common within soft-bottom environments.

While acknowledging that OWFs disrupt the marine environment, the aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of scour protection on fish assemblages, relate them to the effects of designated artificial reefs (ARs) and, ultimately, reveal how future scour protection may be tailored to support abundance and diversity of marine species. The results revealed frequent increases in abundances of species associated with hard substrata after the establishment of artificial structures (i.e., both OWFs and ARs) in the marine environment.

Information on fine-scale habitat use patterns would be helpful in evaluating this. Little is known about the fine-scale movement patterns of Red Snapper around artificial reefs. The present study examined fine-scale (similar to 1-m accuracy) movements of Red Snapper with the Vemco VR2W Positioning System. This system enabled continuous monitoring of tagged fish from 100 to 694 d. Locations of individual fish were recorded approximately every 10 min and totaled over 1.9 million accurate locations of Red Snapper from August 2010 through May 2012. Red Snapper showed close association with the reef structure (mean +/- SD distance = 26.3 +/- 35.4 m) but differential habitat use in relation to both diel and seasonal periods. Home range areas (95% kernel density estimates [KDE]) were significantly larger during day than night periods and showed the lowest area use at dawn and dusk. Monthly home ranges (95% KDE) and core areas (50% KDE) were significantly larger in spring, summer, and fall than in winter and were significantly correlated with water temperature, suggesting colder winter temperatures reduced Red Snapper movement. Home range area was significantly correlated with fish size (407-590 mm standard length), and the fish in this study showed the highest site fidelity (88% still present after >10 months) of any Red Snapper in other previous studies.

Annual gross revenue from the commercial fishery of one open-access dive tour artificial reef analyzed in this study is 4% of the annual pre-tax profit of dive tours operating on this same reef. Moreover, the daily estimated catch from this reef is equivalent to the estimated annual sustainable yield, suggesting that the fishery is capitalizing on fishes aggregating to the reef rather than in situ production.

The harm typically associated with attraction is that fish will be easier to harvest due to the existing biomass aggregating at a newly deployed reef. This outcome of fish attraction has not progressed past an anecdotal form, however, and is always perceived as a harmful process. We present a numerical model that simulates the effect that a redistributed fish biomass, due to an artificial reef, has on fishing catch per unit effort (CPUE). This model can be used to identify the scenarios (in terms of reef, fish, and harvest characteristics) that pose the most risk of exploitation due to fish attraction. The properties of this model were compared to the long-standing predictions by Bohnsack (1989) on the factors that increase the risk or the harm of attraction. Simulations revealed that attraction is not always harmful because it does not always increase maximum fish density. Rather, attraction sometimes disperses existing fish biomass making them harder to catch. Some attraction can be ideal, with CPUE lowest when attraction leads to an equal distribution of biomass between natural and artificial reefs. Simulations also showed that the outcomes from attraction depend on the characteristics of the target fish species, such that transient or pelagic species are often at more risk of harmful attraction than resident species. Our findings generally agree with Bohnsack's predictions, although we recommend distinguishing mobility and fidelity when identifying species most at risk from attraction, as these traits had great influence on patterns of harvest of attracted fish biomass.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Babcock, Kendra K.; Cesbron, Florian; Patterson, William F., III; Garner, Steven B.; Waidner, Lisa A.; Caffrey, Jane M.",Changing Biogeochemistry and Invertebrate Community Composition at Newly Deployed Artificial Reefs in the Northeast Gulf of Mexico,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,43,4,680,692,10.1007/s12237-020-00713-4,Jun-20,2020,"Artificial reefs have been deployed throughout US coastal waters since the late 1970s, primarily to enhance fisheries.

In this study, we examined the relationships among epifauna, algae, and biogeochemical processes on artificial reefs located on the shallow Florida shelf in the Northeast Gulf of Mexico over a year following their deployment. We measured oxygen and nutrient fluxes, attached chlorophyll a, and invertebrate macrofauna. Temporal differences in biomass and chlorophyll a production occurred due to changes in in situ conditions including fluctuations in bottom-water temperature over the year as well as decreasing bottom-water oxygen and increasing chlorophyll a fluorescence during the summer. Invertebrate biomass was greater than micro- or macroalgal biomass. Biomass of the invertebrate epifaunal community increased exponentially during the first 5 months of this study. The reef was net heterotrophic with few differences between oxygen or nutrient fluxes in the light and dark.

Larval production at King Harbor has decreased over the study period, as has the size of the fish assemblage. Both declines may be related to recorded increases in water temperature. Larval densities from similar water depths (0-15 m) throughout the bight vary widely between sites and years. However, the mean percentage represented by reef fish among all larvae at King Harbor was 51% during those 5 years for which bight-wide samples were available (35% for all years) compared to 5% in the bight-wide samples.

Trachurus trachurus only occasionally uses artificial reefs as oases of highly abundant resources. Scomber scombrus does not feed on fouling fauna and therefore its augmented presence in OWFs is probably related to reasons other than the enhanced food availability.

The ecological carrying capacity of C. japonica and R. venosa were 4. 038 and 2. 482 t . km-2 . a-1, and sustainable catches of these two species in 10 years was 1. 17 t . km-2 a-1 and 0. 96 t . km-2 . a-1 in the ecosystem. The ecological carrying capacity of A. japonucus was 50. 80 t . km-2, which can be released at rates ranging from 22. 38 to 29. 85 t . km-2. a-1 and an annual catch of 8. 95-11. 94 t . km-2 . a-1 can be taken two years later. In four to five years, the ecological carrying capacity will be reached and then stop the release. The ecosystem can be kept stable with the catch rate in the next five years.

For an adequate definition of an artificial reef, all its pathways of interaction with the ecosystem must be quantitatively assessed. In this way, the final design will lead to an increase in the production of services. Therefore, this study presents the MEEM tool as well as the AREIT index. Through the former, it is possible to obtain different reef solutions, while the index allows the user to select the best alternative by taking into account the specific situation of the ecosystem to be enhanced. The AREIT index facilitates the decision-making process by means of a three-dimensional graphical representation, based on the three aspects of greatest relevance for the ecosystem: energy, nutrient circulation and the presence of cavities for the shelter of species, in particular those of fishing interest. The definition process ends with the application of a procedure for calculating the stability of the final design under the action of waves and currents. Overfishing and pollution have led to marine habitat degradation, and as a result, marine fisheries are now in decline. Consequently, there is a real need to enhance marine ecosystems while halting the decline of fish stocks and boosting artisanal fishing. Under these circumstances, artificial reefs (ARs) have emerged as a promising option. Nevertheless, their performance is traditionally assessed years after installation, through experimental and field observations. It is now necessary to adopt an alternative approach, adapting the design of artificial reefs to the specific characteristics of the ecosystem to be enhanced. In this way, it will be possible to determine the potential positive impacts of ARs before their installation. This paper presents a general and integrated conceptual framework to assist in the design of AR units by adopting an ecosystem ecology (EE) perspective. It consists of three main parts. In the first one, starting from an initial geometry, EE principles are used to include modifications with the aim of improving autotrophic resource pathways (additional substrata and increased nutrient circulation) and leading to a habitat enhancement (more shelter for individuals). The second part of the framework is a new dimensionless index that allows the user to select the best AR unit design from different alternatives. The potential impacts on the ecosystem in terms of energy, nutrient cycling and shelter are considered for such a purpose. Finally, a general hydrodynamic methodology to study the stability of the selected AR unit design, considering the effect of high waves under severe storms, is proposed. The framework is applied through a case study for Galician estuaries.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Endo, Hikaru; Nishigaki, Tomokazu; Yamamoto, Keigo; Takeno, Koji","Subtidal macroalgal succession and competition between the annual, Sargassum horneri, and the perennials, Sargassum patens and Sargassum piluliferum, on an artificial reef in Wakasa Bay, Japan",FISHERIES SCIENCE,85,1,61,69,10.1007/s12562-018-1263-9,Jan-19,2019,"Artificial reefs have been introduced onto the subtidal sandy or rocky bottoms of Japanese coasts to expand the marine macroalgal beds that enhance the production of commercially important organisms.

However, little is known about the competitive relationship between these annual and perennial species during succession. In the present study, we examined the successional change in macroalgal biomass on an artificial reef in Wakasa Bay, Japan, and tested the effects of removing annual and perennial species on the thallus length of successional perennial and annual species, respectively. The reef introduced between March and April 2008 was dominated by the annual brown alga Sphaerotrichia divaricata in July 2008, the annual brown alga Sargassum horneri in March 2009, and the perennial species Sargassum patens and Sargassum piluliferum in February 2010. The removal of S. horneri during autumn 2008 resulted in an increased thallus length in S. patens/S. piluliferum in March 2009, but had no effect in February 2010. Similarly, the removal of S. patens/S. piluliferum during autumn 2008 resulted in an increased thallus length in S. horneri in March 2009, but had no effect in February 2010.

We developed and applied a multi-species, individual-based model to examine the long-term effects of increasing number of reefs on fish weight, abundance, and biomass. The model simulated the population dynamics of three fish species for 50 years on a 2-dimensional spatial grid. Growth, mortality, and movement were computed each hour for individuals of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a croaker-like species (Micropogonias chromis), and a pinfish-like species (Lagodon rhomboides). We also included individuals of two other species (bluefish - Pomatomus saltatrix and a generic jack-like species), but only simulated their hourly movement and their effects on prey and predation of the focal species. The densities of five prey groups were simulated independently in each cell. Our results showed that increasing the number of reefs generally produced higher biomass, but at the cost of slower growth, and smaller individuals. Abundance was higher under fixed-AR recruitment and maximum refuge treatments. In all treatments there were diminishing returns on abundance and biomass with increasing number of artificial reefs. Experiment 2 showed that model results based on regularly spaced reefs were consistent with a real layout of reefs currently being sampled in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Management strategies for determining the habitat-value of reefs in the Gulf of Mexico should consider the number of reefs and the local spatial layout of the reefs to ensure they are optimally arranged.

These modifications could, in time, be highly beneficial to any programme of fishery enhancement, protection or restoration but only where the scale of habitat manipulation was relevant to the target fisheries. Ecosystem simulations provide a theoretical basis on which to conduct examinations of habitat manipulation at scales that could not be tested empirically. In the present study, a series of ecosystem models was constructed based on broad-scale simulations for the west coast of Scotland in order to examine the potential consequences to selected fisheries of different scales and types of intervention using artificial reefs. Initialized with a large-scale mass-balance model, a number of smaller-scale dynamic ecosystem simulations covered management situations that encompassed habitat type and reef design for open, restricted and closed fisheries. Spatial simulations examined the presence and absence of artificial habitat with natural reefs and marine protected areas (MPAs) under realistic environmental situations. The simulated trends supported preliminary field observations that artificial habitats would support similar biotic aggregations to natural reefs. Designs that maximized the reef edge as a function of the total reef volume were more productive for some of the functional groups examined compared with larger single deployments of identical area. Increasing the area of artificial habitat did result in improvements to some of the fisheries. The behaviour of some functional groups, however, highlighted the limitations of the broad-scale primary model to smaller-scale investigation.

Lessons from Brazil,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,18,,50,56,10.1016/j.baae.2016.10.002,Feb-17,2017,A major goal of worldwide agriculture over the next 30 years will be to feed a burgeoning population of about 9 billion people. This expansion poses a great challenge because crop production is an activity that profoundly affects natural habitats and biodiversity. An interesting perspective for biodiversity conservation is the incorporation of production systems into overall conservation efforts. Rice is one of the world's major crops and Brazil is the leader in the Western Hemisphere with 35% of the cultivated area. Rice fields are sometimes considered man-made wetlands with potential values for many aquatic species. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize results of studies carried out over the past decade in rice fields of southern Brazil to identify management practices that enhance biodiversity levels in agricultural matrices. We also provide direction to environmentally-oriented legislators for implementing general strategies for rice farmers to supplement aquatic diversity of natural wetlands. Major techniques include: 1) keeping some rice fields flooded during the fallow phase; 2) increasing organic rice production to reduce the use of pesticides; 3) encouraging rice farmers to rejuvenate soils by periodically taking fields out of production; and 4) avoid draining new wetlands for rice production. Incentivizing good management practices in rice fields would transfer some of the responsibilities related to the conservation of biodiversity to production systems.

Current evidence suggests these systems comprise spatially heterogeneous mosaics with respect to artificial structures, pollutants and community composition, while also undergoing biotic homogenization over time. Urban marine ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by several commonly observed patterns and processes, including the loss of foundation species, changes in biodiversity and productivity, and the establishment of ruderal species, synanthropes and novel assemblages. We discuss potential urban acclimatization and adaptation among marine taxa, interactive effects of climate change and marine urbanization, and ecological engineering strategies for enhancing urban marine ecosystems.

As a result, the distribution patterns of POM particles were clearly distinguished according to the shape of the ARs. The accumulation of POM particles on the analysis plane was highest in the cylindrical-type AR, followed by the box-type and hemispherical-type ARs. Many POM particles were distributed in regions where the turbulence energy was strong. The larger the diameter and density of the POM particles were, the closer they tended to be in regions with strong vorticity. Based on the distribution and behavioural characteristics of the POM particles, e.g., thick region, empty region, transport limit line, main layer, and column, it is possible to determine the placement model for marine fisheries, such as ARs.

In this study, ARs were investigated using the actor???network theory (ANT), a holistic approach developed in the social sciences that considers that nonhuman as well as human actors play a role in systems and networks. The findings show that the socioecological objectives of ARs are deeply dependent on the interests of the stakeholders active in each phase of the project: project identification, planning, implementation, monitoring, and management. Their position and interests strongly influence how the project is performed, and the objectives of the ARs also evolve in line with the type of stakeholders involved. Based on the interest of each stakeholder, this ANT analysis reveals that French ARs, called production ARs, also have ecological and social support objectives, including reducing conflict between fishermen or increasing natural marine resources diversity and biomass. The translation process steps provide a framework to understand the interest of each stakeholder involved in the AR network and how management actions are deployed to reach their key objectives.

Experimental tests were conducted to assess the effect of these M-shaped artificial reefs on the vertical and longitudinal turbulent intensity under different hydraulic conditions and geometries, and datasets were collected by using the Particle Image Velocimetry technique implemented within the experimental facility. The distribution and variation characteristics of the turbulence intensity were analyzed, and the main results obtained can confirm that in the artificial reef area, there was an extremely clear turbulent boundary. Furthermore, the area of influence of the longitudinal turbulence was identified to be larger than that of the vertical turbulence, and the position where the maximum turbulence intensity appeared was close to where the maximum velocity was measured. Finally, results demonstrate that low turbulence conditions are typically located in front of the unit reef, the general turbulence area is located within the upwelling zone, and the more intense turbulence area is located between the two M-shaped monocases.

We present two distinct Portuguese AR case studies: (1) The Nazare reef off the central coast of Portugal and (2) the Oura reef off the Algarve coast. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local fishermen in the fishing towns of Nazare and Quarteira pre-and post-AR deployment. The main focus of the interviews was to understand fishermen's perception of AR usefulness (or lack thereof) in terms of nine ecosystem services/additional functions potentially provided by the ARs. We tested the null hypothesis that ARs do not provide additional ecosystem services/additional functions. When queried pre-AR deployment, fishermen indicated that ARs are most likely to provide three ecosystem services: habitat and refuge, biodiversity preservation and food production. Fishermen had similar perceptions post-deployment. For the Nazare reef, fishermen tended to have a positive or neutral perception of ecosystem services/additional functions being provided by ARs. For the Oura reef, fishermen tended to have a mostly neutral perception of AR ecosystem services; however, there were also some positive and other negative perceptions. It was difficult for stakeholders to conceptualize some of the ecosystem services/additional functions provided by ARs prior to actively using them. As a result, some stakeholders changed their perception of the ecosystem services/additional functions after using the structures. These results indicate that stakeholders likely need to perceive ARs as useful in order for them to provide their support for AR installation.

Vertical line and fish traps were used to sample the reef site and a paired control site with soft bottom substrates for 1 year before and 2 years after reef construction.

With the exception of rare occurrences of juvenile Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, which were observed only during the summer recruitment season, the control site exhibited a lack of reef species. In contrast, we documented dramatic increases in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of multiple reef species at the reef site following the addition of structured habitat. Distinct cohorts of Red Snapper could be followed through time suggesting site fidelity, and few fish greater than age 2 years were captured indicating limited migration of older fish from other areas. Given that the reef supported high densities of juvenile Red Snapper that were in good condition, growing quickly, and protected from potential shrimp trawl mortality, export of juveniles (i.e., production) to the adult population was evident and likely greater on a per-unit-area basis than for the control site.

In contrast, the literature contained few studies that unambiguously demonstrated that artificial reefs increased regional fish production rather than merely concentrated available biomass.

OM of pelagic origin was the main source of matter due to the predominance of filter-feeder organisms on the ARs, while benthic primary production was of secondary importance. Isotopic ratios of fishes confirmed the importance of the ARs as a food supplier. Their position in the trophic network was consistent with the hypothesis proposing the effective ability of ARs to increase fish biomass through production mechanisms.

Laizhou Bay is the largest semi-enclosed bay in the Bohai Sea, China, where multiple factors, especially overfishing, have led to the decline of many commercial marine fish stocks. Artificial oyster reefs were developed in 2011 in this region, providing shelter, feeding, and breeding sites for marine organisms. Additionally, stock enhancement by release can be used to replenish fishery species resources. Ad hoc stock enhancement, however, can fail to bring economic benefits and may impact ecosystem stability. Therefore, we estimated the ecological carrying capacity of the three main economic fish species in Laizhou Bay, including black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), fat greening (Hexagrammos otakii), and Chinese seabass (Lateolabrax maculatus) before release to ensure the sustainable use of fishery resources. The Ecopath model in Laizhou Bay was divided into 17 functional groups based on commercial relevance, dietary similarity, and habitat needs of the species present in the area.

First, deploying protected HMRs can help to mitigate the depletion of fishery stocks through overharvest and habitat degradation. Secondly, to achieve this objective effectively, it is essential that HMRs are protected as no-take areas, and that, thirdly, HMRs are large, well-planned, evaluated and monitored. Finally, ecosystem modelling and adaptive management responses are necessary to forecast and manage the benefits of HMRs. Moreover, uncertainty about the resolution of the well-rehearsed attraction/production debate may be resolved by ensuring that HMRs are managed as protected no-take areas.

The platforms that are responsible for harvesting and producing energy provide a hard substrate in areas where most substrate is soft, establishing a habitat for fouling communities to settle and to grow on. With time, these communities start to compose a problem for energy production companies, as their natural increase in biomass may pose risks to the platform foundations, leading to the necessity of performing regular inspection so the installations can keep working properly. To address this issue and to better understand how cleaning efforts can be directed, a model was created to relate the growth of these fouling communities with different environmental variables. The variables tested were related to sea surface salinity and temperature, seafloor topography, distance to shore, depth, current and wind velocity, fish abundance, concentration of suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll and presence or absence of artificial structures.

Artificial reefs (ARs) have multiple beneficial effects involved in increased fishery production. The present study investigated diatom resting stages in the sediments near ARs at a depth of about 90 m by the combined use of direct microscopic observation and the MPN method, seeking a novel function of AR deployment that potentially increases biological production. Although the concentration of diatom resting stages at A2 (north end station of the AR area), composed mainly of Chaetoceros, was ten times the concentration at A5 (non-reef station), the concentration at A1 (south end station of the AR area) was the same level as at A5. These results suggest that the AR contributes to the accumulation of diatom resting stages while the degree of accumulation is attributed to the arrangement of ARs and their physical environment such as flow directions. Interestingly, live pennate diatoms possessing photosynthetic pigments were constantly observed in all samples despite the low light intensity (<= 1.2 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), which provides new ecological insight into their biological and physiological characteristics.

The data, which establishes a baseline condition to use in future assessments, suggest strong differences in both the fish and benthic communities among the surveyed shipwrecks based on the oceanographic zone (depth).

As populations increased, much of this coast has been subject to infill and seaward extension for housing, recreation and industrial development. This has led to degradation of the highly productive intertidal and shallow subtidal marine ecosystems upon which fisheries depend. Further degradation can be expected with future sea level rise, as high evaporation rates will induce hyper saline conditions.Rather than building out into the sea using dredging and infill, an alternative approach is to construct cities on land, safely above future high water levels, by excavating saline desert of low productivity to create marine waterways. Sabah Al-Ahmad Sea City in Kuwait was first connected to the sea in 2004 and, with 3 phases completed, now has 84 km of shoreline in the desert.

These include intertidal beaches, tidal flats, mangrove and salt marshes on islands, together with subtidal sand and rock benthic habitats. These have been monitored with daily physical and annual biological surveys. Importantly, this data provides new information on the natural colonization rates and development of Gulf soft substrate intertidal and subtidal marine communities.

Results showed higher abundance, biomass, and/or species richness of marine organisms in artificial reef areas than adjacent sites, but this was not true for taxa such as noneconomic benthos and phytoplankton. Additionally, mean recapture rates of the four species groups varied from 1.55 to 10.15%, with the highest recapture rate for crabs (mean +/- SD = 10.15% +/- 5.35%). We also found statistically significant correlations between the effect size of artificial reefs on the abundance of economically important fish and non-economic benthos and management mode. The effect size of artificial reefs on non-economic benthos biomass was significantly influenced by the reef area and density. Based on these findings, we concluded that there are three major challenges to the development of sea ranching in China, namely, habitat bottlenecks, recruitment bottlenecks, and management bottlenecks.

Marine coastal fish have a complex life cycle requiring different essential habitats. One of these habitats is known as a nursery, a place where juveniles can settle in large numbers, survive, and grow to contribute to the adult population. Nurseries are mainly found in shallow, sheltered zones and are thus particularly impacted by urbanization, notably by harbors. The vertical featureless structure of docks is very unlikely to be used by juveniles, which need complex habitats to find food and shelter from predators. Recent attempts to rehabilitate the nursery function in such environments by using artificial habitats have proven efficient in increasing juvenile densities. However, nothing is known about the survival of juveniles in these habitats, preventing any conclusions on the effectiveness of this means of restoration from being drawn. Here, we set up tank experiments to test the relationship between habitat preferences and the survival rate of two species of seabream when facing stalk-attacking combers. Habitat choice was consistent with survival results, indicating that artificial habitats might not represent unintended ecological traps for juveniles. However, the artificial habitats' effect on survival was variable between species.

We also report a linear decline in survival of juveniles of both species over the 25-year period.

From a modelling point of view, the creation of new fish biomass would be realized by a shift to a state of higher carrying capacity of the environment (K) for aquatic populations and communities. However, it has not been possible to demonstrate unequivocally rising K as a result of AR deployment because of the difficulty in disentangling enhancements due to simple distributional changes (the attraction hypothesis) versus total abundance rise (the production hypothesis). Here we develop a modelling framework based on simple, inexpensive fisheries data to quantify the impact of ARs, disentangling attraction from production by assessing the rise in regional K. The rationale is that if attraction to ARs from the wider region was the main driver of increased abundance in the ARs then regional K would have remained constant before, during and after deployment of the ARs. Therefore an increase in regional K disproves the hypothesis of attraction. The study case is the fishery for the two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris in southern Portugal. Monthly time series of 27 years of landings, 20 years of fishing effort, were available from three small-scale fleets: one was the artisanal fleet operating on the ARs and the other two were semi-industrial fleets operating on the wider continental shelf. The model that we developed and applied incorporated the data from all fleets so it evaluated the change in regional K. We show that regional K for D. vulgaris increased by 35% after final deployment of the ARs and it did so in linear fashion during four years. From a fisheries perspective the result was more nuanced because although the deployment succeeded in raising regional K, stock biomass and thereby enhancing the artisanal fishery, it also led to a substantial rise in total fishing mortality and exploitation rate because the semi-industrial fleets operating offshore increased their harvest rate nearly 3-fold. Our modelling framework has wide applicability in other regions due to the elementary nature of the necessary fishing monitoring data.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"BAQUEIRO, E; MENDEZ, R",ARTIFICIAL REEFS - AN ALTERNATIVE TO ENHANCE MEXICAN LITTORAL COMMERCIAL FISHERIES,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,55,3-Feb,1014,1020,,Sep-94,1994,"The use of artificial reefs has been officially ignored in Mexico except for a few isolated cases.

PP presented a relative total abundance of 7,088.8 individuals and T 5,523.8 individuals. This difference was related to the greater volume and structural complexity in PP.

The species with the greater relative abundance were Anchoa sp. in PP and Ophistonema oglinum in T.

During the monitoring, the fish assemblages accumulated species and individuals in a non-systematic pattern in the group of non-resident species, as defined here, but the ARs should be close to their carrying capacity.

Research on ARs primarily focused production of marine communities (n = 168). There are important information gaps regarding socioeconomic aspects; design, materials, and disposal in the selected habitats; legal, management, and planning aspects considering long-term monitoring. Regarding effectiveness, few articles (n = 13) allowed comparisons between ARs and NRs, highlighting the need to apply proper reference sites in AR implementations. Meta-analysis showed that ARs are not similar to reference NRs (p = 0.03, common effect and p = 0.05 random effect models).

The assessment of ARs deployment is mostly based on analysis of the evolution of fish communities. Recently, studies have focused on trophic modelling to understand the functioning of such ecosystems in a more holistic approach. Trophic models are able to address this concern by describing the interaction between species at different trophic levels and based on the quantification of energy and matter flows through ecosystems. These models allow the application of numerical methods - also called Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) - to characterize emergent properties of the ecosystem. Usually, ENA indices are proposed as indicators of ecosystem health as they are sensitive to different impacts on marine ecosystems. In the present study, the Ecopath software is used to build an ecosystem model composed of 23 compartments, from detritus and phytoplankton to mammals, to describe the situation beforeand afterthe deployment of ARs in the south of the Bay of Biscay along the Landes coast. In addition, ENA indices are calculated for two periods, beforeand afterthe deployment of artificial reefs, to compare network functioning and the overall properties of the structural trophic network. Our results show little structural change in the ecosystem, with a rearrangement of the trophic levels and a simultaneous increase in biomass and system maturity. These preliminary results evidently need to be confronted with other environmental factors such as, for instance, substrate composition, proximity to natural reefs and larval supply. Nonetheless, we consider that the maturity index could be used as a new indicator to assess the evolution of ARs with specific management objectives.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

For a closer look, the fish assemblage was further divided into visitors and residents, and biomass was used as a parameter to represent production. Visitors were characterised by sporadic occurrences and highly variable school sizes. However, large schools (containing more than 200 kg of biomass) occurred only around small AR piles (consisting of less than 15 units of 2-m(3) concrete reef). Considering visitors alone, the correlation between biomass and pile size was not significant for the combined data from three sites. Changes in the standing stock of residents followed a clearer trend, and the relationship could be fitted to a sigmoidal equation. This trend shows that collections of the residents tended to increase until the pile reached a size of 20-30 reef units. Thereafter, the increase in biomass slowed, and maximum biomass would eventually be reached only with a further increase in the pile size. Predictions of the efficiency of unit reefs for different pile sizes indicate that a pile consisting of 4-10 units of this type of reef would be most effective in terms of biomass of residents. Nevertheless, a size of 15 units is recommended when the behaviour of visitors is taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A total of 5.8 million finfish fry, 5 million molluskan seeds, and 30 million crustacean larvae with some eel and prawn broodstocks have been released up to 1996.Although there are plans to establish sea-farming centers in Taiwan, the organization of the system has not been established completely. Furthermore, regulations on resource augmentation, protection, management of coastal fisheries and stock enhancement are absent or lacking. The success of stock enhancement depends on the pollution control that is in place in coastal areas and the fishermen's awareness of the importance of resource conservation and their involvement.

We review recent studies to evaluate the environmental, performance, and cost characteristics of fuel/propulsion technology combinations that are currently available or will be available in the next few decades. Only options that could power a significant proportion of the personal transportation fleet are investigated.Contradictions among the goals of customers, manufacturers, and society have led society to assert control through extensive regulation of fuel composition, vehicle emissions, and fuel economy. Changes in social goals, fuel-engine-emissions technologies, fuel availability, and customer desires require a rethinking of current regulations as well as the design of vehicles and fuels that will appeal to consumers over the next decades.The almost 250 million light-duty vehicles (LDV; cars and light trucks) in the US and Canada are responsible for about 14% of the economic activity in these countries for the year 2002. These vehicles are among our most important personal assets and liabilities, since they are generally the second most expensive asset we own, costing almost $100 000 over the lifetime of a vehicle. While an essential part of our lifestyles and economies, in the US, for example, the light-duty fleet is also responsible for 42 000 highways deaths, and four million injuries each year, consumes almost half of the petroleum used, and causes large amounts of illness and premature death due to the emissions of air pollutants (e.g. nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particles).The search for new technologies and fuels has been driven by regulators, not the marketplace. Absent regulation, most consumers would demand larger, more powerful vehicles, ignoring fuel economy and emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases; the vehicles that get more than 35 mpg make up less than 1% of new car sales. Federal regulators require increased vehicle safety, decreased pollution emissions, and better fuel economy. In addition, California and Canadian regulators are concerned about lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Many people worry about the US dependence on imported petroleum, and people in both countries desire a switch from petroleum to a more sustainable fuel.The fuel-technology combinations and vehicle attributes of concern to drivers and regulators are examined along with our final evaluation of the alternatives compared to a conventional gasoline-fueled spark ignition port injection automobile.When the US Congress passed laws intended to increase safety, decrease emissions, and increase fuel economy, they did not realize that these goals were contradictory. For example, increasing safety requires increasing weight, which lowers fuel economy; decreasing emissions generally decreases engine efficiency. By spending more money or by reducing the performance of the vehicle, most of the attributes can be improved without harming others. For example, spending more money can lighten the vehicle (as with an aluminum frame with greater energy absorbing capacity), improving performance and safety; a smaller engine can increase fuel economy without diminishing safety or increasing pollution emissions, but performance --We discuss methods needed to evaluate the attractiveness of vehicles employing alternative fuels and propulsion systems including:1. Predicting the vehicle attributes and tradeoffs among these attributes that consumers will find appealing;2. assessing current and near term technologies to predict the primary attributes of each fuel and propulsion system as well as its externalities and secondary effects;3. applying a life cycle assessment approach;4. completing a benefit-cost analysis to quantify the net social benefit of each alternative system;5. assessing the comparative advantages of centralized command and control regulation versus the use of market incentives;6. characterizing and quantifying uncertainty.An especially important feature of the analysis is ensuring that vehicles to be compared are similar on the basis of size, safety, acceleration, range; fuel economy, emissions and other vehicle attributes. Since it is nearly impossible to find two vehicles that are identical, we use the criterion of asking whether consumers (and regulators) consider them to be comparable. Comparability has proven to be a difficult task for analysts. No one has managed a fully satisfactory method for adjustment, although some have made progress. Absurd comparisons, such as comparing the fuel economy of a Metro to that of an Expedition, have not been made because of the good sense of analysts. However, steps should be taken to achieve further progress in developing methods to address this issue.Comparing fuels and propulsion systems require a comprehensive, quantitative, life cycle approach to the analysis. It must be more encompassing than 'well-to-wheels' analysis. Well-to-wheels is comprised of two components, the 'well-to-tank' (all activities involved in producing the fuel) and 'tank-to-wheel' (the operation/driving of the vehicle). The analyses must include the extraction of all raw materials, fuel production, infrastructure requirements, component manufacture, vehicle manufacture, use, and end-of-life phases of the vehicle. Focusing on a portion of the system can be misleading. The analysis must be quantitative and include the array of environmental discharges, as well as life cycle cost information, since each fuel and propulsion system has its comparative advantages. Comparing systems requires knowing how much better each alternative is with respect to some dimensions and how much worse it is with respect to others. Since focusing on a single stage or attribute of a system can be misleading, e.g. only tailpipe emissions, we explore the life cycle implications of each fuel and propulsion technology. For example, the California Air Resources Board focused on tailpipe emissions in requiring zero emissions vehicles, neglecting the other attributes of battery-powered cars, such as other environmental discharges, cost, consumer acceptance and performance. The necessity of examining the whole life cycle and all the attributes is demonstrated by the fact that CARB had to rescind its requirement that 2% of new vehicles sold in 1998 and 10% sold in 2003 be zero emissions vehicles.No one fuel/propulsion system dominates the others on all the dimensions in Table 8. This means that society must decide which attributes are more important, as well as the tradeoffs among attributes. For example, higher manufacturing cost could be offset by lower fuel costs over the life of the vehicle. Changes in social goals, technology, fuel options, customer desires, and public policy since 1970 have changed vehicle design, fuel production, manufacturing plants, and infrastructure. In particular, gasoline or diesel in an internal combustion engine (ICE) is currently the cheapest system and is likely to continue to be the cheapest system through 2020. These vehicles will continue to evolve with improvements in performance; safety, fuel economy, and lower pollution emissions. However, if society desires a more sustainable system or one that emits significantly less greenhouse gases, consumers will have to pay more for an alternative fuel or propulsion system.We review a dozen life cycle studies that have examined LDV, comparing different fuels and/or propulsion systems. The studies are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. The studies vary in the fuel/propulsion options they consider, the environmental burdens they report, and the assumptions they employ, making it difficult to compare results. However, all of the studies include the 'well-to-tank' and 'tank-to-wheel' activities and the majority of the studies include a measure of efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions associated with these activities. We limit our comparison to these activities and measures. The life cycle studies match most closely for the well-to-tank portion and for conventional fossil fuels. See Table 6 for a summary of the ranges of efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reported in the studies for the well-to-tank portion for the various options. For the well-to-tank portion for the production of electricity, renewable fuels, and hydrogen, differing, fuel production pathways are most important. Due to the range of different production options for these fuels (as well as other issues such as study assumptions), results are much more variable. In addition, there is less experience with producing these fuels, resulting in more uncertainty. It is important to distinguish between total and fossil energy required for production when comparing efficiencies among the fuels. Petroleum-based fuels have the highest efficiency for the well-to-tank portion when;total energy is considered. However, if only fossil energy is considered, biomass-based fuels such as ethanol become more attractive.The tank-to-wheel portions are more difficult to compare. Each study uses its selected vehicle (e.g. conventional sedans, light-weight sedans, pickup trucks); many present assumptions regarding the vehicle efficiencies. However, the studies do not generally report the range of assumptions or test conditions.The well-to-wheel results (the sum of the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel activities) of the studies are still more difficult to compare. The baseline vehicle (with a few exceptions) is a current gasoline fueled ICE port fuel injection vehicle; it combines an efficient well-to-tank portion with a relatively inefficient tank-to-wheel portion. A direct injection diesel vehicle is considerably more efficient and therefore results in lower emissions of carbon dioxide even though the carbon content in the diesel is higher than that in gasoline. Fuel cell vehicles have a high theoretical efficiency but generally a low efficiency well-to-tank portion, which offsets some of the vehicle efficiency, benefits.Table 7 shows the ranges of values reported in the life cycle studies for the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. All of the fossil fuel options result in emissions of large amounts of greenhouse gases. Ethanol and hydrogen have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. However, this is highly dependent on the pathways for ethanol and hydrogen production, especially the amount of fossil fuel inputs during production. Some of the hydrogen options result in higher greenhouse gas emissions than those of a gasoline ICE vehicle. Results for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are dependent on the efficiency improvements over conventional vehicles that are assumed.As noted above, Table 8 summarizes our best judgment as to how each fuel/propulsion system combination would be evaluated on each attribute desired by consumers or society. No one system beats the alternatives on all dimensions. The most desirable system is defined by the properties that the evaluator thinks are most important.Despite the many difficulties and complexities, there are some broad conclusions regarding LDV for the next two to three decades. The vehicle options likely to be competitive during the next two decades are those using improved ICES, including HEVs burning 'clean' gasoline or diesel. An extensive infrastructure has been developed to locate, extract, transport, refine, and retail gasoline and diesel. Any alternative to petroleum would require a new infrastructure with attendant disruption and costs running to trillions of dollars. The current infrastructure is a major reason for continuing to use gasoline and diesel fuels.Absent a breakthrough in electrochemistry, battery-powered vehicles will remain expensive and have an unattractive range. The failure to produce a breakthrough despite considerable research does not give much hope that vastly superior, inexpensive batteries will be produced within our time frame.Fuel cell propulsion systems are unlikely to be competitive before 2020, if they are ever competitive. Although, fuel cells have high theoretical efficiencies, and do not need a tailpipe and therefore have vehicle emissions benefits over conventional vehicles, generating the hydrogen and getting it to the vehicle requires large amounts of energy. The current well-to-wheel analyses show that using a liquid fuel and onboard reforming produces a system inferior to gasoline powered ICEs on the basis of efficiency and environmental discharges. Storage of the hydrogen onboard the vehicle is another challenge.Fischer-Tropsch liquids from natural gas and ethanol from biomass may become widespread. The Fischer-Tropsch liquids will penetrate if there are large amounts of stranded natural gas selling for very low prices at the same time that petroleum is expensive or extremely low sulfur is required in diesel fuel. Ethanol could become the dominant fuel if energy independence, sustainability, or very low carbon dioxide emissions become important-or if petroleum prices double.Absent major technology breakthroughs, a doubling of petroleum prices, or stringent regulation of fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions, the 2030 LDV will be powered by a gasoline ICE. The continuing progress in increasing engine efficiency, lowering emissions, and supplying inexpensive gasoline makes it extremely difficult for any of the alternative fuels or propulsion technologies to displace the gasoline (diesel) fueled ICE.This conclusion should not be interpreted as one of despair or pessimism. Rather, the progress in improving the ICE and providing gasoline/diesel at low price has obviated the need for alternative technologies. Many of the technologies that we examine, such as cellulosic ethanol or Fishcher-Tropsch fuels from natural gas or HEVs are attractive. If there were no further progress in improving the gasoline/diesel fuel ICE or the fuel became more expensive, one or more of these options would take over the market. Thus, the fact that the current fuel and technology is so hard to displace means that society is getting what it wants at low cost.Extensive progress has been made by analysts in examining the life cycles of a range of fuels and propulsion systems for personal transportation vehicles. The most important contribution of these methods and studies is getting decision-makers to focus on the important attributes and to avoid looking only at one aspect of the fuel cycle or propulsion system or at only one media for environmental burdens. The current state of knowledge should avoid the recurrence of the fiasco of requiring battery-powered cars on the grounds that they are good for the environment and will appeal to consumers.

Artificial reefs (ARs) are widely used for fisheries management. Research has shown that a mechanism by which ARs in seagrass beds can support fisheries and carbon sequestration is through increasing primary production via fertilization from aggregating fish excretion. Seagrass beds are heavily affected by anthropogenic nutrient input and fishing that reduces nutrient input by consumers. The effect of these stressors is difficult to predict because impacts of simultaneous stressors are typically non-additive. We used a long-term experiment to identify the mechanisms by which simultaneous impacts of sewage enrichment and fishing alter seagrass production around ARs across non-orthogonal gradients in human-dominated and relatively unimpacted regions in Haiti and The Bahamas. Merging trait-based measures of seagrass and seagrass ecosystem processes, we found that ARs consistently enhanced per capita seagrass production and maintained ecosystem-scale production despite drastic shifts in controls on production from human stressors. Importantly, we also show that coupled human stressors on seagrass production around ARs were additive, contrasting expectations. These findings are encouraging for conservation because they indicate that seagrass ecosystems are highly resistant to coupled human stressors and that ARs promote ecosystem services even in human-dominated ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Musa, Fadil; Berisha, Diellza; Musa, Saranda",Aphids (hemiptera: Aphididae) on plum in kosovo,International Journal of Entomology Research,8,5,10,13,,2023,2023,"The species composition of aphids on plum trees (Prunus domestica) in three localities of Kosovo (Prishtine, Obiliq, and Drenas) was investigated during the period 2021-2022.

In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no significant differences between the micro-algae communities developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes, haptophytes, and dinoflagellates.

We used logistic exposure models to assess the effects of timing of nesting, nest attributes (nest substrate, height), and landscape-level variables (inter-nest distance, distance to water, and surrounding habitat type) on daily survival rate (DSR) of Osprey nests. The number of active nests (i.e., nests with eggs) in the study area ranged from 53 in 2013 to 79 in 2016, with an overall total of 329 during the 5-yr study.

Tropical seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems worldwide, yielding tremendous services for society. Yet they are also among the most impaired from anthropogenic stressors, prompting calls for ecosystem-based restoration approaches. Artificial reefs (ARs) are commonly applied in coastal marine ecosystems to rebuild failing fisheries and have recently gained attention for their potential to promote carbon sequestration. Nutrient hotspots formed via excretion from aggregating fishes have been empirically shown to enhance local primary production around ARs in seagrass systems. Yet, if and how increased local production affects primary production at ecosystem scale remains unclear, and empirical tests are challenging. We used a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that combined a data-rich single-nutrient primary production model for seagrass and bioenergetics models for fish to test how aggregating fish on ARs affect seagrass primary production at patch and ecosystem scales. Specifically, we tested how the aggregation of fish alters (i) ecosystem seagrass primary production at varying fish densities and levels of ambient nutrient availability and (ii) the spatial distribution of seagrass primary production. Comparing model ecosystems with equivalent nutrient levels, we found that when fish aggregate around ARs, ecosystem-scale primary production is enhanced synergistically. This synergistic increase in production was caused by nonlinear dynamics associated with nutrient uptake and biomass allocation that enhances aboveground primary production more than belowground production. Seagrass production increased near the AR and decreased in areas away from the AR, despite marginal reductions in seagrass biomass at the ecosystem level. Our simulation's findings that ARs can increase ecosystem production provide novel support for ARs in seagrass ecosystems as an effective means to promote (i) fishery restoration (increased primary production can increase energy input to the food web) and (ii) carbon sequestration, via higher rates of primary production. Although our model represents a simplified, closed seagrass system without complex trophic interactions, it nonetheless provides an important first step in quantifying ecosystem-level implications of ARs as a tool for ecological restoration.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Taylor, Matthew D.; Chick, Rowan C.; Lorenzen, Kai; Agnalt, Ann-Lisbeth; Leber, Kenneth M.; Blankenship, H.

Marine enhancement practice has now matured to the point that quantitative tools are frequently applied before any fish or shellfish are released into the natural environment, and pilot-scale enhancement scenarios and release strategies are evaluated before full implementation.

The mean trophic levels (TLs) of the functional groups ranged from 1.0 for the primary producers (phytoplankton, benthic algae and seagrass) and detritus to 4.14 for Type III fishes (fishes found in the water column above the artificial reefs, e.g., Scomberomorus niphonius). The mean transfer efficiency through the whole system was 11.7%, and the ecosystem had a relative low maturity, stability and disturbance resistance, indicating that it was at a developing stage. Nearly half of the total system biomass (48.9% of 620.20 t km(-2) year(-1)), excluding detritus, was comprised of benthic finfish and invertebrates. The total yield from all fisheries (86.82 t/km(2)/year) was dominated by low trophic level herbivorous and detritivorous species, such as the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (TL = 2.1, 46.07%), other echinoderms (sea urchins Asterias amurensis and Strongylocentrotus nudus, TL = 2.1, 34.6%) and abalone Haliotis discus hannai (TL= 2.0, 18.4%), and as a consequence, the mean TL of the catch was low (2.1). The results from the Ecosim simulation of closing all fisheries for 20 years predicted an increase of about 100% in the relative biomass of the main exploited species, A. japonicus and H. discus hannai. The simulated removal of all kelp farms over 10 years resulted in a two fold increase in the relative biomass of Type III fishes and a 120% increase in their main prey (i.e. Small pelagic fish), while the relative biomass of A. japonicus and Heterotrophic bacteria decreased by 31.4% and 12.7%, respectively. These predictions indicate that nearshore kelp cultivation favours benthic, rather than water column production, and is likely to be providing energy subsidies for the stock enhancement of benthic species in this region.

As Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus) tend to aggregate in order to feed around these reefs, energy profiling and trophic markers were applied to study their feeding ecology in a wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea. The proximate composition (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed significantly between liver and muscle tissue but not between fish species or between their potential prey species. Atlantic cod showed to consume more energy than pouting. The latter had a higher overall energy reserve and can theoretically survive twice as long on the available energy than cod. In autumn, both fish species could survive longer on their energy than in spring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in high concentrations in fish liver. The prey species Jassa and Pisidia were both rich in EPA while Jassa had a higher DHA content than Pisidia.Energy profiling supported the statement that wind farm artificial reefs are suitable feeding ground for both fish species.

In the North Sea alone, the decommissioning liability is estimated at 40 billion by 2040. Current international policy requires removal of offshore infrastructure when their production life ends; however, this policy is being questioned as emerging data reveal the importance of these structures to fish and invertebrate populations. Indeed, some governments are developing 'rigs-to-reef (RTR) policies in situations where offshore infrastructure is demonstrated to have important environmental benefits. Using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), this study quantified and analysed fish and invertebrate assemblage dynamics associated with an oil and gas (O&G) complex in the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation (SAC), in the North Sea, Germany. We found clear depth zonation of organisms: infralittoral communities (0-15 m), circalittoral assemblages (15-45 m) and epibenthic communities (45-50 m), which implies that 'topping' or 'toppling' decommissioning strategies could eliminate communities that are unique to the upper zones. Sessile invertebrate assemblages were significantly different between structures, which appeared to be driven by both biotic and abiotic mechanisms. The O&G complex accommodated diverse and abundant motile invertebrate and fish assemblages within which the whelk BUCCilliLLITI undaturn, cod fish Gothic morhua and lumpsucker fish Cyclopterus lumpus used the infrastructure for different stages of reproduction. This observation of breeding implies that the structures may be producing more fish and invertebrates, as opposed to simply acting as sites of attraction (sensu the 'attraction vs production' debate). At present, there are no records of C. lumpus spawning at such depth and distance from the coast, and this is the first published evidence of this species using an offshore structure as a spawning site. Overall, this study provides important new insight into the role of offshore O&G structures as habitat for fish and invertebrates in the North Sea, thereby helping to inform decommissioning decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Jefferson, Amanda E.; Allman, Robert J.; Pacicco, Ashley E.; Franks, James S.; Hernandez, Frank J.; Albins, Mark A.; Powers, Sean P.; Shipp, Robert L.; Drymon, J.

The goal of this study was to assess age and growth of gray triggerfish from the Alabama Artificial Reef Zone in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Gray triggerfish (n = 1135) were collected predominantly from artificial habitat during 1999-2017. Specimens were sexed macroscopically and ages were assigned by counting translucent increments in sections of the first dorsal spine. Fish ranged in size from 22 to 617 mm fork length. The oldest female was assigned an age of 9 yrs; the oldest male, 10 yrs. A suite of growth models was tested to develop combined and sex-specific models.

The results obtained showed a low genetic variability and a genetic homogeneity of the population, which appears not divided in sub-demes. 3 - Microsatellites revealed a surprisingly low level of genetic variability when compared to allozyme data obtained in previous studies. This is likely due to a difference in the time of response of the two markers to environmental degradation. Microsatellites would lose genetic variability earlier and faster because of their usually high polymorphisms. Conversely, allozymes would be more resistant to genetic erosion, being moderately variable markers. 4 - Selection probably contributed in maintaining allozyme polymorphism, while microsatellites, being neutral markers, did not benefit from the action of selection and lost diversity earlier and more rapidly.

Growth was estimated from weight-converted length increments of 142 Floy-tagged individuals at liberty for a median of 187 days. Egg production was estimated for females of three taxa (four species) as the product of the weight of batch egg production and spawning frequency (the latter determined from histological evidence of day-old postovulatory follicles). Milt production was deduced from male to female ratios of gonad weights for reproductive fish. Somatic growth rates varied three- to fourfold among the six species and, in part, reflected the distribution of maturity stages of intraspecific populations. On average, the per capita growth rates of taxa dominated by immature stages were faster than those dominated by large adults. Somatic production varied more than somatic growth rates (by a factor of 15), because of additional variations in standing stock biomass among populations. The somatic production of at least one species was underestimated as a result of a tag effect on growth. Weight-specific egg production varied only twofold among the three taxa examined, perhaps because fishes with smaller batch egg productions compensated by spawning more frequently, and vice versa. Estimates of weight-specific milt production further diverged because of the influence of relative testis-to-ovary weights that ranged from a small fraction to unity. Additional variation among taxa in total gonadal (egg plus milt) production was about one-half that of somatic production (a factor of eight). Besides representing interspecific differences in adult biomass, variations in gonadal production reflected intraspecific differences in the biomass contributions of the two sexes within the fraction of adults that were reproductively active. Despite likely substantial underestimates of gametic materials, gonadal production ranged from a large fraction to a large multiple of somatic production among the four species.

Predators attracted to ARs can influence the distribution and abundance of prey fish species. Determining the role of predators in AR is important in advancing the understanding of community interactions. This paper documents the effects of predation on fish assemblages of AR located near a coastal lagoon fish nursery. The Dicentrarchus labrax is a very opportunistic species preying on juveniles (0(+) and 1(+) age classes) of several demersal fish species on the ARs. Reef prey and sea bass abundance were negatively correlated. The mean numbers of prey per sea bass stomach increased with the increase of reef fish prey abundance, suggesting that predation has a significant influence, resulting in a decrease in prey abundance. Prey mortality (4-48%) of demersal reef fish associated species depends on bass density. Prey selection was related both with prey abundance and vulnerability. Results showed that D. labrax predation on AR-fish associated species can increase prey natural mortality. However, the role of bass predation on the ecological functioning of exploited ARs is not clear. There may be increases in local fishing yields due either to an increase in predator biomass through aggregation of sea bass attracted to ARs or to greater production. In contrast, predation on juveniles of economically important reef fish preys, especially the most frequent and abundant (Boops boops), can contribute to a decrease in recruitment to the fishery. Our results indicate that inter-specific interactions (predator-prey) are important in terms of conservation and management, as well as for the evaluation of the long-term effects of reef deployment. Thus, it is necessary to consider ecological interactions, such as predation, prior to the development and deployment of artificial habitats as a tool for rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,,,,J,LOFTIN R W; THOMPSON L A,AN ARTIFICIAL NEST STRUCTURE FOR LEAST TERNS STERNA-ALBIFRONS,Bird-Banding,50,2,163,164,,1979,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Carral, Luis; Alvarez-Feal, Carlos; Rodriguez-Guerreiro, M.

This paper reports the spatial effects of a man-made freshwater canal discharge on the population structure, abundance and reproductive characteristics of the sandy beach mole crab Emerita brasiliensis. Along the 22 km of sandy beach sampled, the mole crab showed a marked longshore variability in population structure and abundance. Abundance of different population components (juveniles, males, females and ovigerous females) significantly decreased towards the canal. Population structure by sex and size, individual weight, fecundity and female maturity patterns at size also displayed a non-linear response to the distance from the freshwater discharge. Only the size structure of males did nor follow this pattern. For males, spatial heterogeneity enhanced the detection of density-dependence at less disturbed sites. The authors conclude that artificial freshwater discharges could significantly influence the distribution, abundance and life-history traits of the biota of sandy beaches, and that further study of these ecosystems should include human activities as important factors affecting spatial and temporal trends.

The number of taxon was calculated from the data of both the net types, while the copepod abundance was done using the samples from Model II only. Sixteen species of planktonic copepods, including 5 dominant species, were recorded. Results reveal that Oithona similis was the first dominant species from March to June, and was replaced by Paracalanus parvus in September; both dominated the copepod community in January. Acartia hongi was the second dominant species from March to September. Centropages abdominalis was the third dominant species from March to June, and was replaced by O. similis in September and Corycaeus affinis in January. C. affinis was the fourth dominant species in September. Population density of the dominant copepods was compared with that of other similar regions. We found that the dominant species were mostly small copepods (< 1 mm) except for adult Centrapages abdominalis. Seasonal variation in prosome length of O. similis, C. abdominalis, and C. affinis, and their copepodites were studied for the first time in China. For P. parvus and A. hongi, seasonal trends in prosome length variation were similar with those in Jiaozhou Bay, Yellow Sea, Qingdao, China, in a similar temperate domain.

Various sustenance fisheries are also based on the floating structure, but many of these are relatively minor.Purse seines and ringnets are used to harvest large size tunas, small tunas, and small pelagic species; these kinds of gear differ in terms of scale of operations, level of mechanization, and mode of fishing operation, but essentially capture the same species of similar size ranges.Among handlines, the most dominant handline gear used near payaos has generally been single, large circle hooks that are cast in deep waters (>100 m) to target large yellowfin Thunnus albacares and bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus. Smaller hooks are also used in relatively shallow waters to capture smaller sized yellowfin tuna.Meanwhile, multi-hooked handlines with colored lures are particularly designed for small pelagic species, and troll lines mainly harvest juveniles and adults of other (non-tuna) large pelagic species.Adaptations of fishing techniques to catch various associated species reflect the high level of consolidated fishing efforts near the floating structures.These techniques, in turn, highlight the growing concerns about overfishing and the sustainability of harvestable resources, as well as the need to regulate the deployment of payaos for effective payao fisheries management.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Simmons, Carrie M.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.","TERRITORIALITY, REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR, AND PARENTAL CARE IN GRAY TRIGGERFISH, BALISTES CAPRISCUS, FROM THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO",BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,88,2,197,209,10.5343/bms.2011.1012,Apr-12,2012,"We documented spawning behaviors in gray triggerfish, Batistes capriscus (Gmelin, 1789), in June and July 2004-2007 on artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, including territoriality, nest building, harem spawning, and parental care.

Industrial tropical purse seiners have been increasingly deploying artificial man-made DFADs equipped with satellite linked echo-sounder buoys, which provide fishers with information on the accurate geo-location of the object and rough estimates of the biomass aggregated underneath, to facilitate the catch of tuna. Although several hypotheses are under consideration to explain the aggregation and retention processes of pelagic species around DFADs, the reasons driving this associative behavior are uncertain. This study uses information from 962 echo-sounder buoys attached to virgin (i.e. newly deployed) DFADs deployed in the Western Indian Ocean between 2012 and 2015 by the Spanish fleet (42,322 days observations) to determine the first detection day of tuna and non-tuna species at DFAD and to model the aggregation processes of both species group using Generalize Additive Mixed Models. Moreover, different seasons, areas and depths of the DFAD under-water structure were considered in the analysis to account for potential spatio-temporal and structure differences. Results show that tuna species arrive at DFADs before non-tuna species (13.5 +/- 8.4 and 21.7 +/- 15.1 days, respectively), and provide evidence of the significant relationship between DFAD depth and detection time for tuna, suggesting faster tuna colonization in deeper objects. For non-tuna species, this relationship appeared to be not significant. The study also reveals both seasonal and spatial differences in the aggregation patterns for different species groups, suggesting that tuna and non-tuna species may have different aggregative behaviors depending on the spatio-temporal dynamic of DFADs.

We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo (R) 'shark skin-like' swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo (R) fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed.

The harbours varied in nature from large, international shipping hubs to small, regional fishing harbours and recreational marinas. Fouling assemblages were assessed using visual and scrape sampling to ensure the detection of large, mobile and small inconspicuous species. In total, 29 alien species were recorded, 15 of which were detected outside of their previously known ranges. The number of species recorded per harbour varied from five to. Results revealed that high numbers of alien species were associated with the presence of yachts and low primary productivity. Harbours which had yachts and occurred in areas with mean Chl a minimum levels lower than 0.21 mg.m(-3) had the highest number of alien species, while harbours without yachts that were larger than 0.1 km(2) supported the fewest alien species. These findings suggest that the presence of yachts can be used to identify harbours with high numbers of alien species, particularly in regions with low productivity.

We determined catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch composition, and found 19 species in Punta de Piedra and 36 in Tolu (16 species common to both).

No significant differences in CPUE were found between ARs and no seasonal pattern was evident. The differences in total composition and extracted biomass between ARs were mainly a consequence of greater effort exerted in Tolu, whereas the absence of trends and correlation with environmental factors of CPUE and species caught suggests that the ARs are near their carrying capacity. As expected, the ARs supported and improved CPUE and fishing success in comparison with reported values of natural habitats, traditional fishing grounds and some artificial habitats in the zone, owing to their greater volume, structural complexity and vertical profile.

Quantifying the response of mobile consumers to changes in habitat availability is essential for determining the degree to which population-level productivity is habitat limited rather than regulated by other, potentially density-independent factors.2. Over landscape scales, this can be explored by monitoring changes in density and foraging as habitat availability varies. As habitat availability increases, densities may: (1) decrease (unit-area production decreases; weak habitat limitation); (2) remain stable (unit-area production remains stable; habitat limitation) or (3) increase (unit-area production increases; strong habitat limitation).3. We tested the response of mobile estuarine consumers over 5months to changes in habitat availability in situ by comparing densities and feeding rates on artificial reefs that were or were not adjacent to neighbouring artificial reefs or nearby natural reefs.4. Using either constructed or natural reefs to manipulate habitat availability, we documented threefold density decreases among juvenile stone crabs as habitat increased (i.e. weak habitat imitation). However, for adult stone crabs, density remained stable across treatments, demonstrating that habitat limitation presents a bottleneck in this species' later life history. Oyster toadfish densities also did not change with increasing habitat availability (i.e. habitat limitation), but densities of other cryptic fishes decreased as habitat availability increased (i.e. weak limitation). Feeding and abundance data suggested that some mobile fishes experience habitat limitation, or, potentially in one case, strong limitation across our habitat manipulations.5.

In this connection, the construction of artificial reefs (known as Acadja) for the development on substrates of living communities, and the utilization of this new production to enhance fish growth have been evaluated in Cote d'Ivoire. This paper describes the granulometric, chemical and biological transformation of the sedimentary ecosystem as a consequence of this practice. In the artificial habitat, an increase in the sedimentation rate of the mineral fraction (definitive trapping of particle resuspension generated by the waves and induced by the wind) and of the organic fraction (direct and indirect sedimentation of the epiphytic biomass) constitutes the starting point of significant modifications in epibenthic communities. In the Acadja, the meiofauna, dominated by nematodes and copepods, is somewhat less diversified, some groups being absent or poorly represented (turbellarians, gastrotrichs, ostracods). These characteristics were confirmed by a specific study of the nematode assemblages. In fact, the relatively high diversity of the nematode community in the natural lagoon sediment (dominated seasonally by Paraphanolaimus, Anonchus et Daptonema) contrasts with low diversity in the Acadja sediment, where the community is always dominated by Theristus sp. This lower specific diversity generates a reduction of the trophic types. In the Acadja, only the non-selective detritus feeders colonize the fine and organic sediment. These sedimentological and ecological transformations, which affect the entire ''brush park'' (Acadja), induce a strong eutrophication of the benthic ecosystem.

These ongoing, natural invasions have become greatly augmented by ship traffic in numerous estuaries and harbors where the native biota has been diminished or lost due to habitat destruction and pollution. Some of the invaders proved to be pests, indicating that these kinds of human introductions need to be controlled, but the ultimate management problem is that the invaders have generally increased diversity at the lower trophic levels after the top-level predators were lost or diminished. During the past 20 yr, work on habitat improvement has been progressing within many estuaries. But so far there is little evidence of the final step in restoration, which should be the revival of a balanced, more productive ecosystem.

The model described the material flow through the food webs formed in each ATR type and their potential to increase fisheries production. The model outputs were validated with observational data over three years. The model fit the observed biomass of both prey animals and fish predators. The simulation results highlighted that ATRs, particularly those with additional materials, had two to three times higher feeding flow than the sandy seafloor and resulted in increased fish biomass. Fish catch doubled in the ATR areas compared to the bare seafloor.

Managing such conflicts requires knowledge on the impact of OWFs on the spatial distribution and movement behaviour of fished species. However, such knowledge is still lacking, especially for soft sediment fish such as flatfish, which are vital fisheries resources in the region. Therefore, we used acoustic telemetry to examine the spatial behaviour of European plaice in relation to an OWF and its structures. In a small study area (1.37 km2), we observed high residency for plaice around the turbines and scour protection layer (SPL), which consists of large rocks around the turbine foundation. The fish primarily resided on sandy sediments near the hard substrates, but showed a diurnal pattern of proximity to the turbine, being closer during the day. Considering their trophic ecology, these findings suggest that plaice moves towards the SPL for feeding opportunities on the hard substrate, potentially leading to increased ecological fish production within OWFs. Although most plaice moved away from the OWF in winter, likely towards spawning grounds, many exhibited high site fidelity returning to the study area after the winter migration. OWFs thus offer protection from fishing mortality as closed feeding grounds in spring and summer, but not during winter spawning migrations, which may result in spillover effects.

Fish are thought to settle and recruit to shellfish and seaweed farms; however, there is little published evidence to support this assumption. Shellfish and seaweed farms increase structural complexity and epibiota productivity, which may attract settling fish larvae. In this study, fish settlement and recruitment patterns into 2 aquaculture habitats, mussel-kelp co-culture and mussel farm monoculture, were compared to 2 adjacent natural habitats, soft-sediment seafloor and rocky reef, within a settlement season. Standard monitoring units for the recruitment of fish (SMURFs) were used, as they are a common and reliable method for measuring temporal and spatial variability in fish settlement and recruitment among habitat types. The communities of fish species settling and recruiting to both sets of aquaculture and natural habitats were equivalent. This was most likely due to the artificial 3D structure of the mussel farm habitats functioning in a similar manner to the structural complexity of a rocky reef habitat. Further, there was indication that for at least the most abundant fish species, Fosterygion lapillum, the 2 aquaculture habitats were of sufficient quality to support growth from settlement to juvenile size classes (i.e. in mussel monoculture habitat 65% were newly settled in December, and 86% were of juvenile size class by February).

IMTA, and mariculture in general, when carefully planned, can be suitable for environmental restoration and conservation purposes. Aquaculture, especially mariculture, is a sector that is progressively increasing in parallel with the increase in human needs; however, several problems still affect its development, mainly in relation to the choice of suitable sites, fodder production, and the impact on the surrounding environment. A current challenge that requires suitable solutions is the implementation of IMTA. Unfortunately, some criticisms still affect this approach, mostly concerning the commercialization of new products such as invertebrates and seaweeds, notwithstanding their environmentally friendly character. Regarding the location of a suitable site, mariculture plans are currently displaced from inshore to offshore, with the aim of reducing the competition for space with other human activities carried out within coastal waters. Moreover, in open water, waste loading does not appear to be a problem, but high-energy waters increase maintenance costs. Some suggestions are given for developing sustainable mariculture in the Mediterranean area, where IMTA is in its infancy and where the scarce nutrients that characterize offshore waters are not suitable for the farming of both filter feeder invertebrates and macroalgae. From the perspective of coupling mariculture activity with restoration ecology, the practices suggested in this review concern the implementation of inshore IMTA, creating artificially controlled gardens, as well as offshore mussel farming coupled with artificial reefs, while also hypothesizing the possibility of the use of artificially eutrophized areas.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Tsuchiya, Miho; Takio, Kenji; Ando, Kazoto; Kawabe, Katsutoshi; Komazawa, Ichiro; Arakawa, Hisayuki","Suitable substrate for thalli attachment of the agar alga Gelidium elegans (Gelidiales, Rhodophyta)",NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,75,6,1051,1060,10.2331/suisan.75.1051,Nov-09,2009,"After the volcanic eruption in 2000, the quantity of agar alga Gelidium elegans remarkably decreased in Miyakeshima Island, and so efforts to increase the production are necessary.

For the assessment of species presence and abundance, we used standardised bioacoustic recordings of male anurans advertising in a given microhabitat type complemented with visual species detection and identification. We hypothesize that present-day anuran communities in cultivated marais do not reflect the historical association to gallery forests, but represent assemblages of disturbance-tolerant species, ie. a melting pot of habitat generalists. In fact, microhabitat diversity and species composition were similar at the two study sites and the 13 species detected in the Rugeramigozi wetland were also present among the 17 species detected in the Butare wetland. With the exception of two ubiquist species, none of the species showed a forest-association. Species richness of cultivated valley-bottom wetlands is about a third of total richness in Rwanda and outnumbered that of natural habitats about twofold. We conclude that high species richness and homogeneous species composition is the result of the specific landscape configuration of wetland belts connected over hundreds of kilometres allowing for uninterrupted dispersal along these corridors. Therefore, all species capable of exploiting these habitats could reach any point of the wetland network, i.e. similar-structured cultivated wetlands represent a melting pot of mainly generalist species.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Hertler, H; Spotila, J; Kreeger, DA","Effects of houseboats on organisms of the La Parguera Reserve, Puerto Rico",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,98,3-Jan,391,407,10.1023/B:EMAS.0000038198.47504.dc,Nov-04,2004,"As coastal development increases so too does the number of artificial floating and permanent structures.

On the other hand, these structures can benefit biotic communities by providing sites for attachment of organisms in a substrate-limited environment and both habitat and food sources for fish. In this study, we examined whether houseboats benefit or harm the ecological integrity of a typical seagrass dominated system, at La Parguera, Puerto Rico. We performed a benthic survey to compare the diversity and health of seagrasses under houseboats to that at control locations. Species diversity (0-0.79) varied significantly among sites, but this variability was not attributed to the houseboats. Rather, the variability appeared related to the proximity of the study locations to new development along the shoreline. Average seagrass blade density and length were 52.7 blades/m(-2) and 23.6 cm, respectively. Neither parameter differed between houseboat and control areas; however, both varied significantly among sites. In addition, boat hulls were heavily encrusted with invertebrates. The overall averages of species diversity and richness of sessile organisms on hulls of the houseboats were 1.13 and 4.83, respectively. Fish also utilized these structures.

The sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus and the crabs Cancer polyodon, C. porteri and Paraxanthus barbiger were found to be the most prominent predators in the benthic system.

The highest total biomass and system throughput (33579.3 t/km(2)/year) was calculated for the sand-gravel habitat. The sand habitat had a negative net system production due to the amount of primary production imported from deeper waters to satisfy the food requirements of the large beach clam (Mulinia sp.) populations. The mean trophic level of the fishery varied between 2.06 (sand-gravel) and 3.92 (sand) reflecting the fact that the fishery concentrates on primary producers (i.e. algae and filter feeding), and on top predators (i.e. snails and crabs). Fishery is strongest in sand-gravel habitat, where annual catches amount to 122.05 g/m(2). Low values of the relative Ascendency (A/C) (from 27.4 to 32.7%) suggest that the systems analysed are immature and highly resistant to external perturbations.

No differences in species richness were observed among treatments but diversity was lower within exclosure cages than on cage controls/uncovered panels. In sessile assemblages, structure differed between treatments: cage controls/uncovered panels were dominated by algae and associated mesoherbivores, which were scarce/absent within cages. Exposure to predators also affected the structure of mobile assemblages. The sea urchin Pseudechinus magellanicus (Philippi) occurred within exclosure cages but was never found on exposed panels.

An overview of any potentially negative impacts of such enhancemenis is given. The rise in interest in fisheries enhancement in New Zealand in recent years, which is likely to further increase in coming years, flows from the successful Nelson scallop enhancement programme, encouraging results from other initiatives, and the growing momentum of marine enhancement internationally. However, there is also an increasing awareness that stocking alone is seldom enough, and that successful enhancement often requires restoration of key components of the marine environment itself.

Quantifying the contribution of ARs to coastal ecosystems and fisheries productivity requires an understanding of fish presence at the structure and connectivity with surrounding habitats. In the present study, the movements and presence of 10 eastern fiddler rays (Trygonorrhina fasciata), 17 Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and 18 bluespotted flathead (Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus) were monitored using acoustic telemetry around a designed AR in 38-m depth near Sydney, Australia. Fiddler rays exhibited an average short-term presence of 43% at the AR, and 26% over the similar to 20-month monitoring period, which was significantly higher than the other two species. Fish tagged at the AR showed high affinity to the site at which they were tagged compared with fish tagged on natural reef. All three species moved frequently between the AR and the other reefs in the area, indicating that the AR may increase the connectivity between adjacent habitats and aid the dispersion of benthic species. The moderate presence at the AR suggests that these species may contribute to some biomass production at this AR by incorporating this reef in their natural range.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Buyse, Jolien; Hostens, Kris; Degraer, Steven; De Troch, Marleen; Wittoeck, Jan; De Backer, Annelies",Increased food availability at offshore wind farms affects trophic ecology of plaice Pleuronectes platessa,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,862,,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160730,Mar 1 2023,2023,"Offshore wind farms (OWFs) and their associated cables, foundations and scour protection are often constructed in soft -sediment environments. This introduction of hard substrate has been shown to have similar effects as artificial reefs by providing food resources and offering increased habitat complexity, thereby aggregating fish around the turbines and foundations. However, as most studies have focused their efforts on fish species that are typically associated with reef structures, knowledge on how soft sediment species are affected by OWFs is still largely lacking. In this study, we analysed the trophic ecology and condition of plaice, a flatfish species of commercial interest, in relation to a Belgian OWF. The combination of a stomach and intestine content analysis with the use of biomarkers (i.e. fatty acids and stable isotopes) identified a clear shift in diet with increased occurrences of typical hard-substrate prey species for fish in the vicinity of the foundations and this both on the short and the long term. Despite some condition indices suggesting that the hard substrate provides increased food availability, no clear increases of overall plaice condition or fecundity were found. Samples from within the wind farm, however, contained larger fish and had a higher abundance of females compared to control areas, potentially indicating a refuge effect caused by the cessation of fisheries activities within the OWF. These results suggest that soft-sediment species can potentially benefit from the presence of an OWF, which could lead to fish production. However, more research is still needed to further elucidate the behavioral ecology of plaice within OWFs to make inferences on how they can impact fish populations on a larger spatial scale.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Martell, Luis; Bracale, Roberta; Carrion, Steven A.; Purcell, Jennifer E.; Lezzi, Marco; Gravili, Cinzia; Piraino, Stefano; Boero, Ferdinando",Successional dynamics of marine fouling hydroids (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) at a finfish aquaculture facility in the Mediterranean Sea,PLOS ONE,13,4,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0195352,Apr 2 2018,2018,"Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand.

The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species Obelia dichotoma, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders.

The total biomass of fouling organisms was 2-3 times greater at Gascons than at Grande-Riviere and at both sites decreased with increasing depth. Throughout the study, at Grande-Riviere, at the mouth of the bay, the fouling community was dominated by two bivalves, Mytilus edulis and Hiatella arctica, and the hydroid Obelia gelatinosa was third in abundance. In contrast, at Gascons, 40 km inside the bay, the hydroid Tubularia larynx predominated in the summer while M. edulis and H. arctica predominated in the autumn. Factors potentially explaining the success of M. edulis and H. arctica in the fouling community are the loss of hydroids due to selective grazing by nudibranchs, the rapid growth rate of the bivalves and their ability to inhibit settlement of competitors. Changing the pearl nets regularly results in a sharp increase in the yield of muscle and other soft tissues, but only a slight increase in shell height of the cultured scallops. For example, for a 30-mm scallop suspended at 9 m in depth for 4 months, the increase in muscle mass is 68% greater in cleaned than in fouled nets whereas the difference is only 4.8% for shell height.

The evidence for anthropogenically induced climate change is overwhelming with the production of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels being a key driver. In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources.2. The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future.3. Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields. These factors have been posited as having potentially important negative environmental impacts.4. Conversely, we suggest that if appropriately managed and designed, MREI may increase local biodiversity and potentially benefit the wider marine environment. Installations have the capacity to act as both artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices, which have been used previously to facilitate restoration of damaged ecosystems, and de facto marine-protected areas, which have proven successful in enhancing both biodiversity and fisheries.5. The deployment of MREI has the potential to cause conflict among interest groups including energy companies, the fishing sector and environmental groups. Conflicts should be minimized by integrating key stakeholders into the design, siting, construction and operational phases of the installations, and by providing clear evidence of their potential environmental benefits.6. Synthesis and applications. MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter-disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Ali, Azizi; Abdullah, Muhammad Ruzi; Safuan, Che Din Mohd; Afiq-Firdaus, Aminudin Muhammad; Bachok, Zainudin; Akhir, Mohd Fadzil Mohd; Latif, Roslan; Muhamad, Azri; Seng, Tan Hock; Roslee, Adina; Ismail, Khaira","Side-Scan Sonar Coupled with Scuba Diving Observation for Enhanced Monitoring of Benthic Artificial Reefs along the Coast of Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia",JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10,9,,,10.3390/jmse10091309,Sep-22,2022,"Since the 1970s, artificial reef (AR) deployment has been one of the common approaches to augment the local production of coastal fish in Malaysia. However, there is a lack of strategy to assess and evaluate the success of pre-deployed AR.

This method employs an integrated side-scan sonar with a data acquisition system for the detection of the precise location of the BK AR which were deployed at Tukun Telaga Batin off the Terengganu coastline in 2003 by the Fisheries Development Authority of Malaysia (FDAM). Following the determination of the exact location of three BK AR areas, a scuba diving team was sent to survey the physical conditions of the AR and assess the feasibility of the AR as an artificial habitat for marine life. The scan sonar images were compared with the captured photographs and videos acquired during the scuba diving session for a comprehensive value-added assessment. The collected data from the scuba diving session were also processed to measure the fish diversity, the fish biomass, and identify the fish community surrounding the AR. Based on the results, the BK AR remained in extremely good condition, physically intact, without significant breakage or damage, and with no major subsidence into the sediment after 19 years of deployment. A total of 108 BK AR modules were detected in three large groups using the mosaicked sonar images. Following cross-examination to validate the AR measurements using the AR's shadows on the seafloor, the height of the BK AR consistently ranged from 1.7 m to 1.8 m. In addition, 34 species of fish from 14 families and 26 genera were identified, with most species classified as reef-associated (RA) fish with a biomass value of 1173.31 +/- 1136.69 kg m(-3), indicating the successfulness of the BK AR as fish-aggregating devices (FADs). The growth of hard corals on top of the bioceramic plate of the AR module further supported the diversified community of marine life surrounding the BK AR.

In affected areas, including urchin barrens and those affected by whitening events, coralline algae appear, preventing the attachment of seaweed spores to the substrate. Many methods have been used to restore seaweed beds, such as those employing artificial reefs, seaweed ropes, spore bags, and transplanted cultures. However, such efforts are insufficient to overcome the disappearance of seaweed beds from coastal areas. This study examined the use of a new technique that involves encapsulating seaweed zygotes with polysaccharide-like alginates to improve their attachment using the brown algaSargassum fulvellum, which plays an important role in seaweed forests. We tested the efficacy of encapsulated zygotes using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) panels and concrete bricks in the sea. In the laboratory, the germination percentage of encapsulatedSargassumzygotes was 70% +/- 1.6%, similar to the rate of unencapsulated zygotes. In the field experiment, PVC panels and concrete bricks were coated with encapsulated and unencapsulated zygotes; the germination density and growth rates of encapsulated zygotes were 4 (p < 0.001) and 7 times (p < 0.016) greater, respectively, than those of unencapsulated zygotes.

Therefore, we outline a course of action that considers restoration of ecosystem processes in those systems where off-site land use or physical alterations restrict local management. Upon considering a wetland system, or examining a particular management regime, there are several factors that will allow successful restoration of wetland services. An initial step is examination of the political/social factors that have structured the current ecological condition and whether those realities can be addressed. Most successful restorations of wetland ecosystem services involve cooperation among multiple agencies, acquisition of funds from non-traditional sources, seeking of scientific advice on ecosystem processes, and cultivation of good working relationships among biologists, managers, and maintenance staff. Beyond that, in on-site wetland situations, management should examine the existing hydrogeomorphic situation and processes (e.g., climatic variation, tides, riverine flood-pulse events) responsible for maintenance of ecosystem services within a given temporal framework appropriate for that wetland's hydrological pattern. We discuss these processes for five major wetland types (depressional, lacustrine, estuarine, riverine, and man-made impoundments) and then provide two case histories in which this approach was applied: Seney National Wildlife Refuge with a restored fen system and Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge where riverine processes have been stimulated to restore native habitat.

Enhanced nutrient concentrations and loadings can be observed in several coastal areas of the North Sea. As a result, increases in the concentration, production and changes in the species composition was observed in the phytoplankton. In addition, there are some indications for an increased biomass of macrozoobenthos, whereas an increase in microzooplankton can only be assumed from mesocosm experiments. A concomitant increase of higher trophic levels such as shrimps and fishes, as observed in some coastal regions of the North Sea, is difficult to link directly to eutrophication due to a lack of conclusive field observations showing the causality of the changes. That the large fertilisation process in the North Sea has led to a series of changes is, however, without doubt.

Following over a decade of design, planning, outreach, site surveying, and permitting, PVR was built in 2020 as 18 discrete modules using 52,729 tons of quarry rock placed approximately 8-80 m from existing, unburied rocky-reef habitat. There was no significant accumulation or scouring of sediment due to the placement of the reef and temperature data shows that internal tides regularly inundate the reef with cool, nutrient rich water. Rocky-reef associated taxa rapidly recruited to the restoration site, with visible changes occurring within just a few months post-construction.

Moreover, they are used to support small-scale artisanal coastal fishing by two complementary aspects:(1) The promotion of biological production in impoverished seabeds and sustaining professional artisanal fishing, with 2,684 m(3) of modules arranged in chaotic heaps in five areas, and increasing the biodiversity and the available fishing resources.(2) The protection of priority natural habitats (Posidonia meadows and coralligenous rocks) and to manage and share both resources and fishing grounds among fishermen, with 326 heavy obstacles designed to protect against illegal trawling within the 5.5 km offshore limit These 2,200 m(3) of anti-trawling reefs are spread along 17.5 km, creating barriers perpendicular to the coast. Since they have been installed, a significant decrease in illegal trawling has been observed.In the Cote Bleue Marine Park, the two categories of AR (production and protection reefs) are interrelated in the two protected marine areas (integral reserves of 295 ha where all kinds of fishing activities, scuba diving, and mooring are prohibited).These management tools have worked in an additional way and contributed to the preservation of the traditional small-scale fisheries in the Cote Bleue territory (for about 60 fishermen) at a time when these fishing activities are decreasing in the nearby zones.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"COLLINS, KJ; JENSEN, AC; LOCKWOOD, APM; LOCKWOOD, SJ","COASTAL STRUCTURES, WASTE MATERIALS AND FISHERY ENHANCEMENT",BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,55,3-Feb,1240,1250,,Sep-94,1994,"Current U.K. practice relating to the disposal of material at sea is reviewed. The use of stabilization technology relating to bulk waste materials, coal ash, oil ash and incinerator ash is discussed. The extension of this technology to inert minestone waste and tailings, contaminated dredged sediments and phosphogypsum is explored. Uses of stabilized wastes are considered in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal defense and fishery enhancement. It is suggested that rehabilitation of marine dump sites receiving loose waste such as pulverized fuel ash (PFA) could be enhanced by the continued dumping of the material but in a stabilized block form, so creating new habitat diversity. Global warming predictions include sea level rise and increased storm frequency. This is of particular concern along the southern and eastern coasts of the U.K. The emphasis of coastal defenses is changing from ''hard'' seawalls to ''soft'' options which include offshore barriers to reduce wave energy reaching the coast. Stabilized waste materials could be included in these and other marine constructions with possible economic benefit.

To assess the possibility that the BSA could serve as an index of community functional structure, we measured the effect of fertilization on the slope and intercept of the BSA in nematode communities in a rice-wheat crop rotation over three years. Fertilization increased the BSA intercept but did not affect the slope in either rice or wheat phases, which highlights the stable scaling of BSA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the increasing pressures upon the marine realm threaten marine ecosystems, especially seabed biotopes, and thus a well-planned approach of managing use of marine space is essential to achieve sustainability. The relative value of seabed biotopes, evaluated on the basis of goods and services, is an important starting point for the spatial management of marine areas. Herein, 56 types of European seabed biotopes and their related goods, services, sensitivity issues, and conservation status were compiled, the latter referring to management and protection tools which currently apply for these biotopes at European or international level. Fishing activities, especially by benthic trawls, and marine pollution are the main threats to European seabed biotopes. Increased seawater turbidity, dredged sediment disposal, coastal constructions, biological invasions, mining, extraction of raw materials, shipping-related activities, tourism, hydrocarbon exploration, and even some practices of scientific research, also exert substantial pressure.

However, they also increase the availability of hard substrata for larval recruitment, resulting in the development of a diverse sessile community and associated fish fauna. To describe how the modifications caused by a floating marina affect reef fish assemblages at Sdo Sebastiao Channel, SW Atlantic, a multiparameter probe and a visual census methodology were used to compare the abiotic conditions and the diversity and abundance of fishes between two areas: the area inside the marina where boats are moored and the breakwater, an area more similar to nearby natural rocky shores. The area inside the marina presented more turbid and productive waters, while the breakwater was more turbulent. The abundance of fishes inside the marina was greater than at the breakwater throughout the study, but species richness was higher inside the marina only during the hot and wet period (Austral Summer and Spring). Fish assemblages were strictly different, between areas. Species dominance for each area and at nearby natural rocky reefs was also different. This study shows that artificial habitat causes micro-spatial modifications to local fish assemblages. As spatial variations were related to the behavioural and ecological aspects of fishes, marine facilities should be carefully planned, and engineering principles should be combined with ecological processes to better resemble natural habitats, thereby reducing environmental impacts.

Seen from today's productivist point of view, this is not too difficult a challenge to meet. Besides socio-economic and geopolitical considerations, it is now of the utmost importance to consider any such increase in food production from a global environmental perspective. Man-made changes to the environment are numerous, some perhaps irredeemable. The essential human activities of agriculture, animal production and fisheries also affect the environment and some quantitative data are available on such impacts.Each progress in increasing agricultural resources (reclaiming new land areas for agriculture, increase in land productivity, intensification of animal production etc.,) is not without disadvantages (deforestation, pollution of underground water through different contaminants). intensification of land animal production, facilitated also by progress in biotechnological methods leads to increased contamination of the natural food chain and to the concentration of effluents. Aquatic production, currently undergoing tremendous progress, is also facing several such dangers: over-exploitation of natural resources; slow disappearance of natural breeding grounds; increased pollution of water through industrial, agricultural and aquacultural activities. Every such menace to the future of food production has its solution.

Recent deep water surveys indicate that populations continue to decline with no signs of recruitment, despite the closure of the fishery in 1996. Four sites with artificial reefs (n = 12/site) in optimal white abalone habitat were established. No wild white abalone have been found at these sites. Captive abalone were spawned in the spring of each year from 2012 to 2015.

Density surveys and mark-recapture population estimates were done at sites with pre-existing swimming nets and compared to control sites where only natural habitat was present. A manipulative experiment was conducted in which panels of swimming net material were installed at two sites in Sydney Harbour, with comparisons to control sites over a period of 14 months (April 2018 to June 2019) to test whether the installation of swimming nets would affect seahorses on surrounding natural habitat or increase site abundance. The pre-existing and installed swimming nets were found to support greater densities ofH. whiteias well as some increases in site-scale abundance, with no effects on seahorse density on natural habitats.

In Malaysia, rice fields can be an important habitat for migrating birds due to Malaysia's position on the East-Asian-Australasian Flyway. We determined bird abundance, species richness, and composition in rice field landscapes and compared these during different stages of rice growing. Wetland and terrestrial birds were counted in rice fields using the point-count method. Sixty sampling points were randomly established in three locations, from which 3447 individual birds of 46 species and 26 families were recorded.

Three 30-day experiments were conducted in heterotrophic microcosms to quantify how populations of micro- and meio-faunal organisms affect mineralization using the apparent mineralization rate (AMR), i.e., nitrate production, as a proxy. Tryptone, mesocosm detritus, and fishmeal were used as organic substrates (C:N ratios 4-8). Harpacticoid copepods dominated the meiofauna in numbers (87%) and biomass (90%). AMR was inversely related to meiofaunal mass and not related to ciliate density.

Anthropogenic debris travels across large distances and is ubiquitous in the water and on shorelines, yet, observations of its sources, composition, pathways, and distributions in the ocean are very sparse and inaccurate. Total amounts of plastics and other man-made debris in the ocean and on the shore, temporal trends in these amounts under exponentially increasing production, as well as degradation processes, vertical fluxes, and time scales are largely unknown. Present ocean circulation models are not able to accurately simulate drift of debris because of its complex hydrodynamics. In this paper we discuss the structure of the future integrated marine debris observing system (IMDOS) that is required to provide long-term monitoring of the state of this anthropogenic pollution and support operational activities to mitigate impacts on the ecosystem and on the safety of maritime activity. The proposed observing system integrates remote sensing and in situ observations. Also, models are used to optimize the design of the system and, in turn, they will be gradually improved using the products of the system. Remote sensing technologies will provide spatially coherent coverage and consistent surveying time series at local to global scale. Optical sensors, including high-resolution imaging, multi-and hyperspectral, fluorescence, and Raman technologies, as well as SAR will be used to measure different types of debris. They will be implemented in a variety of platforms, from hand-held tools to ship-, buoy-, aircraft-, and satellite-based sensors. A network of in situ observations, including reports from volunteers, citizen scientists and ships of opportunity, will be developed to provide data for calibration/validation of remote sensors and to monitor the spread of plastic pollution and other marine debris. IMDOS will interact with other observing systems monitoring physical, chemical, and biological processes in the ocean and on shorelines as well as the state of the ecosystem, maritime activities and safety, drift of sea ice, etc. The synthesized data will support innovative multi-disciplinary research and serve a diverse community of users.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Komyakova, Valeriya; Chamberlain, Dean; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Swearer, Stephen E.",Assessing the performance of artificial reefs as substitute habitat for temperate reef fishes: Implications for reef design and placement,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,668,,139,152,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.357,Jun 10 2019,2019,"Artificial reefs (ARs) have been advocated and implemented as management tools for recreational fisheries, species conservation and habitat replacement. For ARs to function as substitute habitat for degraded natural reefs, they should perform as dose as possible to local natural reefs, however this is seldom investigated. Here we evaluated the performance of new custom-designed reef structures (CDARs) as fish habitat. As a benchmark for their success, we compared fish abundance, diversity and community composition on CDARs to another commonly used AR type (Reef Balls (RBs)) and nearby natural reefs. Fish were monitored on all reef types over two recruitment seasons at three locations in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Overall, there were no consistent differences in fish density among reef types, although densities on both AR designs were markedly lower than natural reefs at some locations. However, fish species richness on the CDARs was, on average, 2x higher than natural or RB reefs. There were large dissimilarities in fish community composition among reef types across all locations and years. These dissimilarities declined over time with the CDARs becoming more similar to natural communities than to RB reefs. Our results suggest that CDARs can play a role in reef fish conservation where natural reefs are under threat, supporting natural community structure and enhancing local biodiversity. Overall, our findings suggest that la cation of deployment, rather than design, has a more significant influence on fish abundances on ARs, whereas reef design is an important determinant of species diversity and community structure irrespective of location. ARs represent an important management tool for enhancing fisheries productivity and conservation in areas where reef habitat has been degraded or lost. However, failure to incorporate consideration of reef location and design into future AR deployments may lead to poor performance and failure to achieve restoration or conservation goals.

The passive listening survey proved to be successful in detecting S. umbra drumming sounds in two Venetian inlets and on a natural rocky habitat, whereas this species was absent in the inner Venice lagoon. Within one of the two inlets, pulse rate was positively related to the nearest distance of the listening points to an artificial rocky reef. The meta-analysis allowed the identification of a 16-species cluster significantly associated with S. umbra, a large number of which represent commercially important species.

The amount of rocky reef habitat has significandy decreased; as such, determining the optimum technique for restoring this lost habitat is the focus of this study. Over the past decade, we mapped and intensively surveyed the nearshore physical and biological characteristics both inside this impacted area and in surrounding reference areas that contain extensive rocky reef habitat with established kelp forests. Notable among all survey locations is a relatively high-relief (similar to 5 m) area of reef within the sediment impacted area that consistently has the highest fish bio-mass density among anywhere on the peninsula. The high structural relief prevents sediment accumulation, scour, and subsequent reef burial, and this reef ultimately served as the example for the design of sets of quarry rock reef blocks that together form the proposed restoration reef. Our primary objective was to use the 63,500 metric tons of quarry rock the budget would allow us to create the most productive habitat by restoring the natural reef environment while balancing scientific study design considerations (i.e., replicated reef components at multiple spatial scales) with maximizing the potential for an effective restoration effort across the range of important species and overall kelp forest biodiversity. To meet this objective, we considered multiple criteria that incorporated engineering specifications and biological performance and were informed by the scientific literature and results of natural and artificial reef surveys in this region. Ultimately, the design incorporated heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales while attempting to maximize high relief components, surface area to volume ratio, perimeter, ecotones, and small-scale current flow features and nutrient flux and while being consistent with the size of natural reefs along the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Further, placement and spacing of individual reef blocks (i.e., 2 X 48 m heterogeneous quarry rock reefs) included space for sand channels between blocks to permit sediment transport and create sand/rock ecotone habitats while remaining close enough to each other and existing natural reefs to maintain biological connectivity. Reef blocks were also located at the depth (15-20 m) where the most productive reef habitat in the region was observed.

The importance of this endeavor prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to evaluate their sun-to-shade coffee restoration program in Puerto Rico initiated in 2003. We quantified the responses of 12 resident avian species using estimates of local occupancy and extinction probabilities based on surveys conducted in 2015-2017 at 65 restored farms grouped according to time-since-initial-restoration (TSIR): new (2011-2014), intermediate (2007-2010), and old (2003-2006). We also surveyed 40 forest sites, which served as reference sites. Vegetation complexity increased with TSIR, ranging between 35 and 40% forest cover in farms 6-9 years TSIR. Forest specialists (e.g. Loxigilla portoricencis) exhibited highest average occupancy in farms initially classified as intermediate (6-9 years) and old (>10 years), paralleling occupancy in secondary forests. Occupancy of open-habitat specialists (e.g. Tiaris olivaceus) was more variable, but higher in recently restored farms. Restoring the shade layer has the potential to heighten ecological services derived from forest specialists (e.g. frugivores) without losing the services of many open-habitat specialists (e.g. insectivores).

Artificial reefs (ARs) have been distributed across the nGOM in attempts to enhance reef fish habitat and increase fishery productivity, but few data exist to distinguish ecological from fishery functions of ARs compared to natural reefs (NRs), particularly at the regional scale. Therefore, we conducted remotely operated vehicle surveys of reef fish communities at 47 reef sites within a similar to 20,000 km(2) area of the nGOM shelf and tested the effect of reef type (NR versus AR), depth (<= 35 or >35 m), relief (<= 2m or >2 m), and complexity (low or high) on fish diversity and community structure as well as trophic guild- and species-specific densities. Twenty-one species were present at >20%, nine at >50%, and three at >75% of study reefs. Fishery species (i.e., Lutjanus campechanus, Serioia dumerili, and Rhomboplites aurorubens) and invasive Pterois volitans were frequently observed (>50% of sites) or numerically dominant, especially at ARs. Main effects did not significantly affect the presence of specific species or trophic guilds, but interactions among factors significantly affected species- and trophic guild-specific densities. Our results indicate that effects of habitat characteristics on fish communities are more nuanced than previously described. Fish communities are moderately similar at the majority of sites but specific habitat characteristics can interact to dramatically affect densities of some species, particularly those that depend on complex structures for refuge. Simple ARs tend to concentrate high densities of a few important fishery species with low densities of other small demersal reef fishes. Complex NRs with high relief also support high densities of planktivorous fishery species but greatly increase densities of small, demersal, non-fishery species that directly utilize complex reef structure for refuge.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"LOFSHOLMIN, A",INFLUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ON EARTHWORMS (LUMBRICIDAE),ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA,33,3,225,234,10.1080/00015128309439886,1983,1983,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"GAYMAN, W",OFFSHORE DREDGING STUDY - ENVIRONMENTAL ECOLOGICAL REPORT,OCEAN MANAGEMENT,4,1,51,&,10.1016/0302-184X(78)90014-8,1978,1978,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Seaman, William",Artificial habitats and the restoration of degraded marine ecosystems and fisheries,HYDROBIOLOGIA,580,,143,155,10.1007/s10750-006-0457-9,Apr 1 2007,2007,"Artificial habitats in marine ecosystems are employed on a limited basis to restore degraded natural habitats and fisheries, and more extensively for a broader variety of purposes including biological conservation and enhancement as well as social and economic development. Included in the aims of human-made habitats classified as artificial reefs are: Aquaculture/ marine ranching; promotion of biodiversity; mitigation of environmental damage; enhancement of recreational scuba diving; eco-tourism development; expansion of recreational fishing; artisanal and commercial fisheries production; protection of benthic habitats against illegal trawling; and research. Structures often are fabricated according to anticipated physical influences or life history requirements of individual species. For example, many of the world's largest reefs have been deployed as part of a national fisheries program in Japan, where large steel and concrete frameworks have been carefully designed to withstand strong ocean currents. In addition, the differing ecological needs of porgy and sea bass for shelter guided the design of the Box Reef in Korea as a device to enhance productivity of marine ranching. The effect of these and other structures on fisheries catch is positive. But caution must be exercised to avoid using reefs simply as fishing devices to heavily exploit species attracted to them. No worldwide database for artificial habitats exists. The challenge to any ecological restoration effort is to define the condition or possibly even the historic baseline to which the system will be restored; in other words, to answer the question: Restoration to what?

All use ecological data as a basis for physical design of restoration structures. The use of experimental, pilot and modeling practices is indicated. A context for the young field of marine restoration is provided by reviewing major factors in ecosystem degradation, such as high stress on 70% of commercially valuable fishes worldwide. Examples of habitat disruption include an extensive hypoxic/anoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico and nutrient and contaminant burdens in the North Sea.

The disease is characterised by gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances. In cases of severe toxicity, paralysis, coma and death may occur. There is no immunity, and the toxins are cumulative. Symptoms may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. The epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resources. Ciguatera is an important medical entity in tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and in the tropical Caribbean. As reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas, it has become a world health problem. The disease is under-reported and often misdiagnosed. Lipid-soluble, polyether toxins known as ciguatoxins accumulated in the muscles of certain subtropical and tropical marine finfish cause ciguatera. Ciguatoxins arise from biotransformation in the fish of less polar ciguatoxins (gambiertoxins) produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus, a marine dinoflagellate that lives on macroalgae, usually attached to dead coral. The toxins and their metabolites are concentrated in the food chain when carnivorous fish prey on smaller herbivorous fish. Humans are exposed at the end of the food chain. More than 400 species of fish can be vectors of ciguatoxins, but generally only a relatively small number of species are regularly incriminated in ciguatera. Ciguateric fish look, taste and smell normal, and detection of toxins in fish remains a problem. More than 20 precursor gambiertoxins and ciguatoxins have been identified in G. toxicus and in herbivorous and carnivorous fish. The toxins become more polar as they undergo oxidative metabolism and pass up the food chain. The main Pacific ciguatoxin (P-CTX-1) causes ciguatera at levels = 0.1 mug/kg in the flesh of carnivorous fish. The main Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX-1) is less polar and 10-fold less toxic than P-CTX-1. Ciguatoxins activate sodium ion (Na+) channels, causing cell membrane excitability and instability. Worldwide coral bleaching is now well documented, and there is a strong association between global warming and the bleaching and death of coral. This, together with natural environmental factors such as earthquakes and hurricanes, and man-made factors such as tourism, dock construction, sewage and eutrophication, may create more favourable environments for G. toxicus. While low levels of G. toxicus are found throughout tropical and subtropical waters, the presence of bloom numbers is unpredictable and patchy. Only certain genetic strains produce ciguatoxins, and environmental triggers for increasing toxin production are unknown. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Increased densities of all studied piscivores (cod, eel, shorthorn sculpin), as well as the reef-associated goldsinny wrasse, were observed close to the foundations in the first years of operation.

All three site types quickly lured males away from their natural sites. In comparison to those living on natural sites, those using artificial sites were less likely to move to different areas and had a higher reproductive success. When given no choice, male reproductive success was correlated to structural type. A second experiment provided males with an additional structure after using the intermediate quality type for 2 months. Males would often initially use both sites but would eventually shift their spawning activity to the new site if it was of the same quality or better than the old one. However, males would not move if the new site was of inferior quality. When given a new site identical to the initial one, approximately half of the males shifted to the new site.

Less studied is how seascape context may affect other aspects of habitat quality including growth, condition, or production of focal species. Juvenile white grunts Haemulon plumierii are known to rest on patch reefs during the day and move into seagrass habitat at night to feed, linking multiple habitats through these daily foraging migrations. We created artificial reefs across a gradient of seagrass cover and determined how juvenile white grunt condition, growth, abundance, and secondary production were related to seagrass cover within the seascape. White grunt abundance was positively correlated with the cover of seagrass within the seascape, while condition (relative condition factor, K-n) and growth rate (measured using the ratio of RNA to DNA) did not vary among reefs within different seascapes. Secondary production of white grunts was found to be highest on reefs in seascapes with more seagrass. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased food resources associated with higher seagrass cover contribute to increased grunt production. Differences in habitat quality among reefs in different seascapes were manifest at the population (abundance) and ecosystem function (secondary production) levels and not at the individual level (individual growth rate or condition factor).

Structural complexity is often associated with elevated fish abundance, and recent studies have indicated that such structural complexity (e.g. reefs) not only acts as a fish aggregator, but also increases fish production. The objective of this study was to advance this knowledge by investigating if an underlying mechanism of the observed productivity is related to reduced metabolic rates (proxy for energy use) of fish in reef habitats. Using juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, we tested the hypothesis that fish energy use differs between fish occupying stone reef and sand bottom habitats. Metabolic rate (MO2) was estimated using intermittent flow respirometry in simulated stone reef and sand bottom habitats over 24 h. Results revealed that G. morhua in the stone reef habitat exhibited significantly reduced accumulated MO2 compared to G. morhua in the sand bottom habitat. Likewise, there was a tendency for lower mean standard metabolic rates of the fish in stone reefs, although this pattern was not statistically significant. There are many mechanisms that may underpin elevated productivity in structurally complex habitats such as reefs, including better access to shelter and increased food availability.

A total of 234 vessels were sampled and 85 species were identified at the three sites, showing that the use of fisheries targets multiple species. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to analyze the production and fishing effort data. The largest landing was shown at Mucuripe (10.16 ton), which also had the highest mean production (224 kg). Mucuripe employed the highest mean effort (2711 hook*hour) and showed the highest number of species per boat, and Batoque the lowest (48 hook*h). Two-way ANOVA was used to test differences in richness and catch per unit effort(3) (CPUE) across sites and between seasons. There was no difference in CPUE across sites. The species richness was different across sites, with the highest average in Mucuripe (6.4 species per boat) and the lowest in PCV (3.6 species per boat).

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the ability of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L., 1758) larvae to utilize natural odor cues to locate nursery habitats along ontogeny and to examine how it varies with individual's physiological condition. The hypothesis being tested is that S. aurata larvae prefer coastal rocky reefs as nursery areas, but they might use coastal lagoons as nursery grounds ecosystems known for their productivity if under starvation conditions, as a compensatory mechanism to avoid slow growth or even death. A choice-chamber experiment was used to investigate the behavioral responses of satiated and starved laboratory-reared S. aurata larvae, along ontogeny (pre-flexion, flexion, post-flexion), to water collected in a coastal artificial rocky reef and a coastal lagoon. The physiological condition of S. aurata larvae was determined by analyzing several biochemical condition indices. Complementarily, a new set of four preference indexes were developed Choice-Chamber Preference Indexes and discussed to provide a clear measure of the behavioral changes of a species along ontogeny by balancing all the behavioral choices made during the experimental trials, including the unresponsive behavior. A developmental threshold was identified at 24 days post-hatching, before which insufficient swimming capability disabled responsive behavior. Beyond this threshold, post-flexion larvae preferred rocky coastal water over lagoon water, even if under starvation conditions or poor physiological condition, despite the fact that the unresponsive behavior was largely predominant. S. aurata larvae displayed a cautionary behavioral strategy, so the compensatory mechanisms to ensure metapopulation stability and resilience have to rely on their feeding plasticity and on being a batch-spawning species (i.e., diversified bet-hedging strategy) to compensate the lack of apparent behavioral plasticity.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Moon, Seong Ju; Dae-Young, Kim，; An, Young-Su; Sung-Guk, Yang，",A Historical Review on the Process and Prospect of Korea and Japan Marin Ranching Project,The Review of Business History,29,4,137,164,,2014,2014,"Marin ranching consists of resources cultivation(environment creation, restocking), fisheries control, fisheries catch for sustainable production, stable management, and affluent fishing village.

Most of the water properties in the low lying areas of the wetland were comparable with the relevant standards for freshwater fishery. The study highlights the scope for utilization of the planktonic communities as live feed for fish by introducing the practice of concurrent rice-fish culture in low lying areas of wetlands. This is likely to increase the total production per unit area of wetland rice fields through production of not only the particular rice variety but also additional production of fish. Through this practice the marginal farmers in wetlands will be benefited by greater per capita fish protein availability which they can harvest from their rice fields or can sell the surplus fish to local markets.

By manipulating the density and size structure of populations of the blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) in the field via size-selective removals, this experiment aimed to identify the effects of size-selective harvesting on the (1) growth, (2) maturation, (3) sex change, and (4) reproductive output of a protogynous hermaphroditic reef fish that uses exogenous cues for sex change. Removals of 25% of fish established in populations on standardized artificial reefs simulated a pulse of fishing mortality with minimum size limits, slot size limits, and maximum size limits, which are used in some fisheries. Size-selective removals had no statistically significant effects on the growth, maturation, sex change, or reproduction in blackeye gobies, indicating that this protogynous species is resilient to moderately intense size-selective removals. Some trends consistent with predicted effects of size-selective removals were present, but we had low power to detect some effects. Specifically, the rate of maturation was highest in the slot size limit treatment, and the rate of sex change was highest where large fish had been removed. Regardless of simulated fishing type, populations in all treatments exhibited similar size- and sex-structure by the end of the experiment, nearly two months after population structure had been manipulated. These results suggest that sequentially hermaphroditic fishes with exogenous cues for sex change may be able to quickly replace individuals with high reproductive value after experiencing moderately intense size-selective harvesting. However, experiments incorporating additional sex-changing species, particularly with different modes of reproduction and cues for sex change, as well as higher fishing intensities or longer durations of fishing are still necessary to reconcile differences in results reported herein and those from modeling and correlative studies.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Jouvenel, JY; Bachet, F; Harmelin, JG; Bellan-Santini, D","Biological monitoring of a marine reserve ('Cote bleue' marine park, Marseilles Bay, Mediterranean Sea, France).",REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE,59,2-Jan,243,251,,2004,2004,"The Cote Bleue marine parc, located between Fos and Marseilles (French Mediterranean coast), includes two fisheries reserves at Carry-le-Rouet (85 ha, created in 1983) and Cape Couronne (2 10 ha, created in 1996), both provided with anti-trawling and production artificial reefs.

Here, we quantified the recovery of faunal biodiversity and abundance toward a predisturbed state following structural restoration of oyster habitats globally. We found that while restoration initiates a rapid increase in biodiversity and abundance of reef-associated species within 2 years, recovery rate then decreases substantially, leaving a global shortfall in recovery of 35% below a predisturbed state.

A review found that the main factors affecting species composition and abundance in rice fields during the growing season were water level, flooding period, rice plant structure and size, and pesticide use. Highest bird density and diversity occurred at intermediate water levels (10-20 cm). Early flooding and late drying favored waterbird density and diversity, and the stopover of migrating species. Taller plants, at higher densities, reduced prey availability to most waterbirds but favored smaller species. Pesticides and herbicides have been shown to be toxic to birds and reduce food resources. A case study is presented for the Ebro delta, Spain. Three management schemes were compared: organic, agri-environmental and conventional. Bird density, biomass and diversity throughout the growing and non-growing seasons were determined in three consecutive years. Bird biomass, density and diversity averaged higher in the organic rice fields, but only biomass was significantly different. The higher biomass reflects the presence of a higher biomass of prey items (fish, invertebrates and macrophytes) in the organic rice fields, likely due to the lack of pesticides.

Monthly length (dorsal oval) frequency data were analyzed using the FISAT II software package. Growth parameters were estimated with the ELEFAN I routine, using the von Bertalanffy seasonal growth model. The relationship between fecundity and individual size was estimated by linear regression. The exploited population had individual maximum sizes smaller than both those on the unexploited beach and in the population studied 16 years ago on the same beach. The percentages of ovigerous females were smaller than in 1999, and also differed widely between the two populations, with the exploited-beach population having one-fourth as many ovigemus females. This population showed smaller sizes at sexual maturation and low fecundity, and the females were 20% smaller. This study showed that the observed interpopulational differences in the size structure and reproductive parameters of Callichirus major can be attributed to overfishing, and indicated that the exploited population will tend toward collapse if regulatory measures to limit or prohibit fishing are not implemented.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Salmah, M.

We varied adult sex ratios on artificial patch reefs, monitored egg production over 20 days, and examined rates of sex change. We found no evidence that sex ratio influenced the size at which individuals change sex despite its influence on relative reproductive success. The sex ratio influenced the average reproductive success of males but not females, with males having both a higher probability of mating and higher per capita reproductive success on strongly female-biased reefs. However, females did not capitalize by changing sex to male more frequently. Female per capita reproductive success did not vary with changes in the sex ratio or female density, suggesting that females were not limited by male or resource availability. Male to female sex change was rare, suggesting that, although physiologically possible, this behavior may be uncommon in natural populations.

The abundance and community compositions of biodiversity indicators in fields of break and cereal crops changed when planted with the dedicated biomass crops, miscanthus and short rotation coppiced (SRC) willow. Weed biomass was consistently greater in the two dedicated biomass crops than in cereals, and invertebrate abundance was similarly consistently higher than in break crops. Using canonical variates analysis, we identified distinct plant and invertebrate taxa and trait-based communities in miscanthus and SRC willows, whereas break and cereal crops tended to form a single, composite community. Seedbanks were shown to reflect the longer term effects of crop management. Our study suggests that miscanthus and SRC willows, and the management associated with perennial cropping, would support significant amounts of biodiversity when compared with annual arable crops.

The study was conducted to provide a marine ranching model to Nauru and to set up a fisheries cooperation. Nauru, a less developed country that relies heavily on seafood for food resources, has been experiencing a severe fiscal deficit. However, fisheries production has been declining due to the excessive exploitation of fisheries resources and a recent change in the ocean environment due to global warming. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to introduce a marine ranching system to Nauru, which can act as a means to increase fisheries resources by creating an artificial fishing ground and fisheries resources. Since the Nauru inhabits coral reefs with pelagic fishes migrating around its coast, a floating artificial reef marine ranching seems necessary for the area. Thus, by applying the Korean marine ranching system to Nauru, Nauru can expect positive results in the provision of seafood security as food resources through strengthening the base of fisheries production. This will also bring an increase in income for fishermen and facilitate the fishing community's regional economy.

Carbon isotope values of A. sclerolepis were similar to those in previous investigations, with enriched values in natural habitat (mean = -13.9 parts per thousand, SE=0.6) and depleted values (-19.1 parts per thousand, 0.1) in artificial habitat. A. sclerolepis in natural habitat consumed large amounts of seagrass during the day and night, and at night also ingested small quantities of crustacean prey. In artificial habitat, A. sclerolepis consumed macroalgae during the night and switched to invertebrates (terrestrial ants) in the day. Values of delta(15) supercript stopN in all the fish were 3-8 parts per thousand more enriched than sources. Mathematical modelling of feasible source mixtures showed that in natural habitat the bulk of the dietary carbon is obtained from seagrass, but the nitrogen is obtained from animal prey. In artificial habitat, carbon is obtained from a mixture of macroalgae and animals. We could not determine the nitrogen sources in artificial habitat of A. sclerolepis since, even after accounting for trophic fractionation of delta(15) supercript stopN, the values were outside the range of potential sources. If the types of animals ingested vary over time, perhaps one or more types of animal important in the provision of nitrogen was not sampled during the study. This study demonstrates that not only does A. sclerolepis occur in both artificial and natural habitats, but it uses the same strategy of bulk herbivory with the inclusion of smaller amounts of animal prey.

The present study investigates the influence of a seaweed farm, and the fanned seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum in particular, on fishery catches using a traditional fishing method (madema basket traps) in Chwaka bay (Zanzibar, Tanzania). The results suggest that a seaweed farm, compared to a seagrass bed. had no influence on catch per unit effort (no. of individuals per catch, or catch weight) or no. of species per catch, but significantly affected catch composition (i.e. how much that was caught of which species). The two species contributing most to differences between the sites were two economically important species; the herbivorous seagrass rabbit fish Siganus sutor, which was more common in the seaweed site and is known to graze on the fanned algae: and the benthic invertebrate feeder chloral wrasse Cheilinus chlorourus, more common in the seagrass site. Compared to vegetation-free bottoms, however, the catches were 3-7 times higher, and consisted of a different set of species (ANOSIM global R > 0.4).

Based on the data for landings and effort, weighted catch per unit of effort (CPUE) is computed for the trawl, purse seine and traditional fleets. The weighted CPUE differentiates the quality or composition of catch through weighting of the species mix in the catch by the share of total revenue of each species. Similarly, the various inputs that constitute fishing effort are weighted by their respective cost shares. The ratio of the Tornqvist chain catch and effort indices was used to measure intertemporal productivity changes in the respective fisheries. The results showed that the weighted CPUE was the highest for purse seine on the east and west coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. However, the productivity of purse seine fleet has not been tremendously increased over time. The productivities of trawl and traditional fleets on the east and west coasts were low. Restricting fishing effort through vessel limitation programs is viewed as a possible way of raising the productivities of these fleets. In addition, productivity increases can be achieved by enhancement of the resource stocks such as through the construction of artificial reefs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Continuing threats to the heritage estate concomitant with expanding urban and industrial developments has raised concerns directed at the future conservation and resilience of the reef ecosystems, along with maintaining expected human lifestyles and livelihoods it provides. The data here shows that break walls and pontoons/jetties dominate development, contributing to approximately 10% (equivalent) of the coastline linear length. Most (60%) development occurs along the coastline or within the first few kilometres upstream along estuaries. While conservation and protection of natural coastal habitats is still preferred for the objective of fisheries production and biodiversity, managers must consider seascape implication/benefits more broadly when approving new marine infrastructure rather than a case-by-case approach which further contributes to an ad hoc mosaic seascape of natural and engineered habitats. Not only within the GBR heritage estate, but more broadly, coastal managers need to regard wider seascape connectivity processes during the assessment of any new development.

Estuarine fisheries in urban areas have often shifted away from commercial harvest towards recreational fishing, fuelled by a diverse range of motivational factors. These systems are thus often dominated by recreational and subsistence fisheries, with the fisheries system variously impacted by eutrophication, contamination and pollution, altered trophic structure, habitat loss and hard structure. Urban marine ecosystems may be distinguished by the absence of spawning by exploited finfish, coupled with the gradual loss of environmental signals for recruitment, reduced larval supply and loss of nursery habitats for juveniles, but alongside an abundance of hard structure habitats for adults. The shift from commercial fishing to preferential harvest of more predatory sportfish means that the historical trophic structure has shifted towards lower trophic levels (e.g. prawns, detritivores, planktivores). We outline urban estuarine fisheries ecology as a developing paradigm defined by the unique ecological attributes of urbanised estuaries, the socio-economic objectives of fishers therein, and bottlenecks to productivity of the species they exploit.

Here, data from 35 lowland European streams was used to explore the responses of multiple taxonomic groups to disturbance from agricultural land use, mainly gradients in total phosphorus (TP). We studied responses of fish, invertebrate, macrophyte and benthic diatom assemblages to TP, based on univariate metrics that characterize alpha-diversity (taxon richness, Simpson diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness) and abundance, and multivariate community structure. Multivariate dispersion was used to infer beta-diversity characteristics in two groups of streams with low and high levels of TP. Three of the five metrics of alpha-diversity and abundance of primary producers were significantly related to resources, however, the direction of change was not always consistent with our predictions; macrophyte diversity decreased, whereas benthic diatom diversity increased with elevated nutrients. For consumers, taxon richness increased (fish) or decreased (invertebrates), while fish assemblages had lower phylogenetic diversity (taxonomic distinctness) associated with disturbance, implying a loss of functional diversity. In line with our predictions, fish and invertebrate assemblages showed homogenization of beta-diversity with disturbance. Our finding that beta-diversity of the two primary producers remained relatively high, while alpha-diversity either decreased (macrophytes) or increased (benthic diatoms), suggests that local disturbance is to some extent compensated for by among-site diversity. Our finding that secondary producers showed homogenization of beta-diversity with disturbance has strong management perspectives, suggesting that these groups will need to be more carefully managed to maintain diversity at the landscape level, potentially sustaining resilient communities.

Nevertheless, there are also nitrogen-rich wastewater streams like landfill leachate or reject waters from dewatering of digested sludge, for which traditional nitrification/denitrification can be generally ineffective due to free ammonia inhibition of nitrification and unfavorable biodegradable carbon content for denitrification. Because of high requirements for oxygen and the necessity for addition of external carbon source, treating such nitrogen-rich streams with nitrification/denitrification would become expensive and unsustainable.

The main advantages of this process compared to the conventional nitrification/denitrification are: low sludge production, decrease of the aeration costs by almost 60% (only half of the ammonia is oxidized to nitrite in the nitritation process without farther oxidation to nitrate), and no need for external organic carbon source addition (Anammox process). Furthermore, anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium under anoxic conditions with nitrite as the electron acceptor, and converse energy for CO2 fixation. Additionally, the biomass yield of the Anammox process is very low (0.08 kg VSS kg NH4-N-1 in comparison to 1 kg VSS kg NH4-N-1 in conventional nitrification/denitrification process) consequently, little sludge is produced. The low sludge production is another factor that contributes to the substantially lower operation costs compared to conventional denitrification systems.Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are oxidative methods which are based on the generation of the hydroxyl radicals, which are very reactive and less selective than other oxidants. In the wastewater treatment technology, AOPs can be used in a combination with conventional biological techniques (so called hybrid processes), as pre- and post- treatment processes. The advanced oxidation processes have been used in order to increase the biodegradability and also detoxification of the wastewater.The ability of fungi to degrade lignin-cellulose debris is well known. In addition to these natural molecules they may also degrade synthetic compounds, including synthetic dyes. High effectiveness of Evans blue and brilliant green mixture removal by all tested strains was demonstrated. The process was the most effective and fast in shaken conditions. Finally strain MB removed 90% of tested mixture in shaken samples after 96h. It was the best result reached among all the strains used in the experiment. High removal efficiency was accompanied by a decrease of toxicity (from V class to III class in test with D. magna and from IV class even to non-toxic in test with L. minor). The highest decrease of phytotoxicity was noticed in samples with shaken biomass in which the effect of dyes mixture elimination was the beg. The research indicates very high potential of tested strains for decolorization and detoxification of dyes mixture.Constructed wetlands are man-made system mimicking the process occurring in natural wetlands. These systems are considered to be an alternative to more technically advanced waste water treatment technologies. The development of constructed wetlands is envisaged to pursue the following directions grouped according to: the type of the waste water to be treated, target contaminants, treatment intensification methods, ancillary benefits and the locality.Mycorrhiza fungi can be used for phytoremediation proccess. They support plant growth by lowering the stress caused by the lack of phosphorus and water. They produce enzymes participating in several stages of xenobiotics decomposition, which is helpful in their further biodegradation performed by the other rhisospherical organisms. The natural colonisation of PAHs contaminated soil is a long-term process. It could be shortend by adding fungal propagules as an inoculum to the soil. Fungi used for the injections should be isolated from PAHs contaminated soil. That guarantees their survival and development in the contaminated environment. The level of PAHs elimination from soil depends on a type of bioremediation modification used. It was shown that the best results are obtained with monocotylous plants combined with bacterial and fungal biopreparations obtained from contaminated soil. The symbiosis of mycorrhiza fungi with monocotylous plants caused ca. 40% increase of 3, 4, 5 and 30% of 6-ring hydrocarbons removal from soil in comparison with the conventional methods.Important aspect of environmental protection and engineering is the possibility for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of complex microbial communities, responsible for biotechnological processes, such as: soil bioremediation, wastewater treatment or composting.Due to the fact that most of the environmental bacteria cannot be grown in the laboratory conditions molecular techniques are widely used in environmental engineering. Among these methods the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based and hybridization-based (such as Fluorescent in situ Hybridization; FISH) techniques are known to be the most useful.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Chakraborty, Sourabh; Paul, Niladri; Chaudhuri, P.

Recent studies of Sibidongpado Shipwreck were only focused and limited on the archaeological sites and period of celadon production. Also, it is hard to assume production sites by cultural heritages excavated from Haenam(海南) district. In addition, understanding of archaeological ship and cultural heritage characteristics were only conducted related to maritime transportation without integrated analysis of tribute maritime transportation system of Goryeo dynasty.

The production sites of the celadon from the Sibidongpado Shipwreck were similar systems of klin sites of Jinsan-ri 74 and 20, Haenam, and its production period was estimated for the 1st quarter of the 12th century. In addition, it was seen that the Sibidongpado Shipwreck was the tribute carrier forwarded to Gaesung, and the excavated cultural heritages have the meaning of celadon distributed at the turning point from early celadon to middle celadon. This paper analyzed more systematically the celadon from the Sibidongpado Shipwreck, Gunsan than precedents studies which were not spotlighted due to the lacked material for study.

Fishes aggregate in areas of high habitat complexity at biomass levels which, in areas protected from fishing, may significantly (by 2 to 5 times) exceed levels supported by primary production within the ecosystem. High relief natural areas 'act' like artificial reefs in terms of aggregating fishes. Reef fish abundance is also affected by fishing pressure in the main Hawaiian Islands. Areas protected from fishing (Marine Life Conservation Districts, MLCDs) support standing crops of reef fishes that average about 45 g m(-2) higher than areas open to fishing. In areas unprotected from fishing, reef fish abundance has significantly declined in recent years. Conservation and management of reef fishes would be improved if more high relief areas were protected from fishing. Thus far, 11 MLCDs have been established in such areas in Hawaii, The discharge of primary or secondary treated sewage effluent into the ocean in Hawaii through deep ocean outfalls causes no apparent negative environmental impact to coral reef ecosystems. Deep ocean outfalls in fact attract reef fishes. Increases in abundance around the outfalls appears to result from increased habitat complexity brought about by the construction of the pipelines and surrounding caprock and concrete. A small amount of the variability (increase) in reef fish abundance around the outfalls may also be due to food subsidies (particulate organic matter) in the effluent. No species of fish, coral, invertebrate or algae at the outfalls exhibited any pathological symptoms. Hence, statewide declines in reef fish abundance in areas unprotected from fishing are not related to the discharge of sewage effluents via deep ocean outfalls.

However, little is known about the community changes occurring in the water masses surrounding aquaculture sites. In the present study, we studied the eukaryotic communities inside and outside salmonid aquaculture cages through time to assess the community changes in the neighbouring waters of the farm. Water samples were taken biweekly over five months during the production phase from inside the cages and from nearby points located North and South of the salmon farm. Eukaryotic communities were analyzed by eDNA metabarcoding of the partial COI Leray-XT fragment. The results showed that eukaryotic communities inside the cages were significantly different from those in the outside environment, with communities inside the cages having higher diversity values and more indicator species associated with them. This is likely explained by the appearance of fouling species that colonize the artificial structures, but also by other species that are attracted to the cages by other means. Moreover, these effects were highly localized inside the cages, as the communities identified outside the cages, both North and South, had very similar eukaryotic composition at each point in time. Overall, the eukaryotic communities, both inside and outside the cages, showed similar temporal fluctuations through the summer months, with diversity peaks occurring at the end of July, beginning of September, and in the beginning of November, with the latter showing the highest Shannon diversity and richness values.

Whilst most studies have focussed on exposure of wildlife to EDCs via aquatic routes, there is the potential for transfer into the terrestrial food chain through consumption of contaminated prey items developing in sewage sludge and waste water at sewage treatment works. In this study, we determine levels of EDCs in aerial insects whose larval stages develop on percolating filter beds at sewage treatment works. We compare absolute concentrations of known EDCs; with those collected from aquatic environments not exposed to sewage effluent outflow. Our findings document for the first time that aerial invertebrates developing on sewage filter beds take up a range of chemicals thought to be incorporated from the sewage effluent, which act as endocrine disruptors. For two synthetic chemicals (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and butylated hydroxy aniline), concentrations were significantly higher in insects captured around percolating filter beds than sites over 2 km from the nearest sewage works. A number of species of insectivorous bats and birds, some of which are declining or threatened, use sewage works as principle foraging sites.

Populations continue to decline despite the closure of the fishery in 1996. There has been little to no evidence of recruitment in southern California from population surveys and in artificial reefs targeting white abalone recruitment since the listing of the species. A 13-y time series of white abalone abundance in prime habitat, surveyed with a remote-operated vehicle, was used in a population viability analysis to quantify: (1) the population decline and (2) the time to reach a quasiextinction threshold. The annual decline in the population is 12%, which is comparable to adult natural mortality rates for abalone species. The quasi-extinction threshold of 1,000 individuals is met within 15 y. These results confirm that the white abalone populations in southern California are at high risk of extinction, and highlight the importance of active stocking and restoration for the species. To inform restoration, a deterministic density-dependent size-based matrix model was developed to investigate different stocking scenarios, incorporating an innovative method for modeling low populations by setting the reproductive term as a function of adult density to mimic a reproductive Allee effect. A minimum density of 0.14 abalone/m(2) of stocked juveniles led to a maximum population growth rate (lambda) of more than or equal to 1 for the model population within 10 y but that recovery was poor (mean lambda(15-20) <= 1.0) over time if the level of juvenile stocking was less than 0.23 abalone/m(2) in the model population. The innovative approach of incorporating adult density into the reproductive term in the model quantitatively shows how low population densities can impact threatened and endangered species, and may be widely used for other species.

The study was done at two mussel farms in the Magdalen Islands, eastern Canada. Fish and macroinvertebrates were sampled in different areas within farms sites and in adjacent natural vegetated and unvegetated habitats. The instantaneous growth rates of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) and the rock crab (Cancer irroratus) were estimated using physiological indicators (RNA/DNA ratios). The results demonstrated that mussel sites are not equivalent to natural structurally complex seagrass beds with respect to fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Several species were abundant in mussel farms, including winter flounder and rock crab. This work, however, provided little evidence to suggest that there was greater productivity of these fish and macroinvertebrates at mussel farms, as growth rates were usually equivalent in different habitats.

This interaction can drive upwelling, retention or export. Hence understanding the connection between offshore waters and the inner shelf is needed as it influences the productivity potential of valuable coastal rocky reefs. Near urban centres, artificial reefs enhance fishing opportunities in coastal waters, however these reefs are located without consideration of the productivity potential of adjacent waters. Here we identify three dominant modes of mesoscale circulation in the EAC separation region (~31.5-34.5 degrees S); the 'EAC mode' which dominates the flow in the poleward direction, and two eddy modes, the 'EAC eddy mode' and the 'Eddy dipole mode', which are determined by the configuration of a cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy and the relationship with the separated EAC jet. We use a Lagrangian approach to reveal the transport pathways across the shelf to understand the impact of the mesoscale circulation modes and to explore the productivity potential of the coastal waters. We investigate the origin (position and depth) of the water that arrives at the inner-mid shelf over a 21-day period (the plankton productivity timescale). We show that the proportion of water that is upwelled from below the euphotic zone varies spatially, and with each mesoscale circulation mode. Additionally, shelf transport timescales and pathways are also impacted by the mesoscale circulation. The highest proportion of upwelling (70%) occurs upstream of 32.5 degrees S, associated with the EAC jet separation, with vertical displacements of 70-120 m. From 33 to 33.5 degrees S, water comes from offshore above the euphotic layer, and shelf transport timescales are longest. The region of highest retention over the inner shelf is immediately downstream of the EAC separation region. The position of the EAC jet and the location of the cyclonic eddy determines the variability in shelf-ocean interactions and the productivity of shelf waters.

In total, 157 species of macrobenthic fauna were collected, of which 56 were polychaetes, 49 were crustaceans, and 33 were mollusks. Polychaetes constituted the dominant taxon and accounted for 55% of the average density of the macrobenthos. The sediment around the rocky reef comprised mainly coarse-grained particles, and was dominated by suspension-feeding polychaetes. Cluster analysis divided the macrobenthic community into three groups, which were correlated with the distribution of polychaete species. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that sediment composition is an important variable in polychaete distribution patterns. This study suggests that polychaetes are a representative taxon around subtidal rocky reefs, and changes in sediment type is a key factor influencing the characteristics of polychaete communities.",,,,,,,,,,,C,"Syatrawati; Ngatimin, Sri Nur Aminah; Asmawati",Flowering weeds and Coccinellids species in white maize field,INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE CEREALS AND CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN THE TROPICS,484,,,,10.1088/1755-1315/484/1/012110,2020,2020,"The use of pesticides as a pest control in conventional cropping systems has caused various adverse effects such as pest resistance, resurgence and death of natural enemies.

Here, we explore a complementary approach to decision making that is based on the anticipation of future changes in ecosystem state, function and services. Reviewing the existing literature and utilizing a scenario planning approach, we explore how the structure of coral reef communities might change in the future in response to global climate change and overfishing. We incorporate uncertainties in our predictions by considering heterogeneity in reef types in relation to structural complexity and primary productivity. We examine 14 ecosystem services provided by reefs, and rate their sensitivity to a range of future scenarios and management options. Our predictions suggest that the efficacy of management is highly dependent on biophysical characteristics and reef state. Reserves are currently widely used and are predicted to remain effective for reefs with high structural complexity. However, when complexity is lost, maximizing service provision requires a broader portfolio of management approaches, including the provision of artificial complexity, coral restoration, fish aggregation devices and herbivore management. Increased use of such management tools will require capacity building and technique refinement and we therefore conclude that diversification of our management toolbox should be considered urgently to prepare for the challenges of managing reefs into the 21st century.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Charnley, Susan","If you build it, they will come: ranching, riparian revegetation, and beaver colonization in Elko County, Nevada",USDA FOREST SERVICE PACIFIC NORTHWEST RESEARCH STATION RESEARCH PAPER PNW-RP,,614,1,#ERROR!,,Apr-19,2019,"In Elko County, Nevada, grazing practices on federal and private lands began to change in the early 1990s to restore proper functioning condition to degraded riparian areas that provide habitat for Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi), which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Changes in grazing management focused on changing the frequency and duration of hot-season grazing in riparian areas. These changes led to the recovery of riparian vegetation accompanied by the natural colonization of streams by beavers. Beavers and their dams, in turn, have enhanced the restoration process. People interviewed for this study observed more water in streams, and water available later into the dry season and during drought years, as one consequence of beaver colonization. They also observed the expansion of green zones in riparian corridors, including more wet meadows and riparian vegetation. Ranchers interviewed identified many benefits of beavers for their ranching operations, especially increased water availability and forage production for livestock. These changes improve livestock health and weight gains, which may translate into financial gains. Ranchers also described drawbacks of beavers, most notably their tendency to dam up irrigation canals that run through hay fields, impeding the flow of water. However, most ranchers believed the benefits of beavers outweigh the drawbacks. Variables that have contributed to successful riparian revegetation as an approach to beaver-related restoration in Elko County include low harvest pressure on beavers, large ranch size, compatible grazing practices, agency and permittee flexibility to try new approaches, strong collaborative relations among agency staff and permittees fostered through long-term relationship building, peer learning through site visits to ranches that demonstrate the benefits of changing grazing management, and research and monitoring to document project outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,C,"Lachs, Liam; Onate-Casado, Javier","Fisheries and Tourism: Social, Economic, and Ecological Trade-offs in Coral Reef Systems","YOUMARES 9 - THE OCEANS: OUR RESEARCH, OUR FUTURE",,,243,260,10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_13,2020,2020,"Coastal communities are exerting increasingly more pressure on coral reef ecosystem services in the Anthropocene. Balancing trade-offs between local economic demands, preservation of traditional values, and maintenance of both biodiversity and ecosystem resilience is a challenge for reef managers and resource users. Consistently, growing reef tourism sectors offer more lucrative livelihoods than subsistence and artisanal fisheries at the cost of traditional heritage loss and ecological damage. Using a systematic review of coral reef fishery reconstructions since the 1940s, we show that declining trends in fisheries catch and fish stocks dominate coral reef fisheries globally, due in part to overfishing of schooling and spawning-aggregating fish stocks vulnerable to exploitation. Using a separate systematic review of coral reef tourism studies since 2013, we identify socio-ecological impacts and economic opportunities associated to the industry. Fisheries and tourism have the potential to threaten the ecological stability of coral reefs, resulting in phase shifts toward less productive coral-depleted ecosystem states. We consider whether four common management strategies (unmanaged commons, ecosystem-based management, co-management, and adaptive co-management) fulfil ecological conservation and socioeconomic goals, such as living wage, job security, and maintenance of cultural traditions.

Anthropogenic activity has long impacted the marine continental shelf down to a depth of approximately -200 m. New activities are now affecting this coastal space such as renewable energies, recreational uses and aquaculture in addition to the traditional ones of navigation or fishing. This evolution raises new sources of conflict amongst users which can require state involvement in order to manage the different stakeholders and pressure groups. However, the coastal space still offers a large potential for development for two reasons. Firstly, the physical three dimensional potential of this space enables the whole water column to be used, principally to increase the fishing productivity as in Japan. Secondly, innovative synergies can be created between socio-technical and ecological uses (a fourth dimension) such as the eco-design of wind turbine foundations in order to create fish habitat or sea grass settlement. This new vision in 4D for the design and the management of coastal infrastructure can potentially reduce the risk of conflict as different uses of the coastal space would not necessarily exclude one another. Indeed, several forms of synergy could be developed such as fisheries with aquaculture or biological sustainability with social acceptability. Until now, limited attempts at such an approach have been done. We suggest this is likely due to the absence of a common eco-engineering vision and the lack of experience amongst biologists and engineers in the co-construction of projects. This eco-engineering, or green vision, also takes into account the complexity and resilience of the ecosystem in the long term, if underwater engineered infrastructures are also eco-designed to increase ecological gain This new conception, for development within the coastal area, provides for an increased bio-oriented complexity to engineered structure and therefore a better resistance of the ecosystem in the long term to anthropogenic pressures and a reduction in multi-user conflicts.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Gissi, Francesca; Koppel, Darren; Boyd, Alexandra; Kho, Fenny; von Hellfeld, Rebecca; Higgins, Stuart; Apte, Simon; Cresswell, Tom",A review of the potential risks associated with mercury in subsea oil and gas pipelines in Australia,ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY,19,4,210,227,10.1071/EN22048,2022,2022,"In the coming years, the oil and gas industry will have a significant liability in decommissioning offshore infrastructure such as subsea pipelines.

Options other than complete removal may be considered where the titleholder can demonstrate that the alternative decommissioning activity delivers equal or better environmental outcomes compared to complete removal and meets all requirements under the OPGGS Act and regulations. Recent research has demonstrated that decommissioning in situ can have significant environmental benefits by forming artificial reefs, increasing marine biodiversity, and providing a potential fishery location. An issue, which has been given less attention, is around contaminants remaining within decommissioned infrastructure and their potential risks to the marine environment. Mercury is a contaminant of concern known to be present in some oil and gas pipelines, but the potential long-term impacts on marine ecosystems are poorly understood. We present a synthesis of information on mercury cycling in the marine environment including key drivers of methylation in sediments and ocean waters, existing models to predict methylmercury concentrations in sediments, and toxicological effects to marine biota.

When used as a soil amendment, biochar can increase soil water retention while enhancing soil properties and stimulating food webs. We investigated the effects of coupled biochar amendment and limited irrigation on belowground food web structure and function in an irrigated maize agroecosystem. We hypothesized that soil biota biomass and activity would decrease with limited irrigation and increase with biochar amendment and that biochar amendment would mitigate the impact of limited irrigation on the soil food web. One year after biochar addition, we extracted, identified, and estimated the biomass of taxonomic groups of soil biota (e.g., bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, and arthropods) from wood-derived biochar-amended (30 Mg ha(-1)) and nonamended soils under maize with limited (two-thirds of full) and full irrigation. We modeled structural and functional properties of the soil food web. Neither biochar amendment nor limited irrigation had a significant effect on biomass of the soil biota groups.

This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic-pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived fi om oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be out focus here.

In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves.

For this purpose, eggs of loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nests under the risk of tidal inundation were transferred into two protected hatchery sites that were constructed on Goksu Delta beach, in which there were no risk of predation and inundation, and the other nests were left to remain in situ. Hatching success of hatchery and natural nests were calculated. In addition, temperatures of both hatchery and natural nests (5 and 6 nests, respectively) were recorded, and sex ratios were determined using these nest temperatures and incubation periods. It was determined that hatching success increased with increasing distance from the sea (until 31 m) (r(2) = 0.98), increasing incubation period (up to 60 days) (r(2) = 0.68), and decreasing clutch size (r(2) = 0.93), implying that the production of male hatchling is high in a nest if hatching success of that nest is high (or vice versa). Mean hatching success, incubation period, and nest temperature for hatchery nests were found to be 72.8%, 51.1 days, and 30.2 degrees C, respectively, while the corresponding values for natural nests were found to be 40.5%, 49.9 days, and 31.1 degrees C, respectively. It was also detected that hatchery nests produced higher proportion of male hatchlings (25.2%) compared with natural nests (13.5%). Based on all these results, it can be concluded that hatchery management on this beach is not a completely effective conservation technique. Nest relocation and/or hatchery management enable the conservationists to increase hatching success rate, but they cause sex ratio alteration.

This study investigates the relationship between stocking density and mating and competitive behavior from the context of the field biology of the dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae (Jordan & Gilbert). Animals were housed in 38 liter tanks at a range of densities and sex ratios (from 2-8 animals per tank), and their reproductive and other social behaviors were monitored from tank introduction through copulation. At low tank densities and even sex ratios but comparatively high field densities, frequency of both mating and competitive behaviors was low in trials. A higher level of males in tanks across all densities increased competition, activity levels, and aggression leading to egg transfer errors and brood expulsion, resulting in lower reproductive success. Across seahorse species, mean and maximum wild densities were consistently lower than those used in ex situ breeding, with adult sex ratios that were significantly female biased. However, significant variation exists in wild seahorse densities across species, with higher densities detected in focal/mark recapture studies and on artificial habitat structures than reported with belt transect sampling techniques. Interchange of knowledge gained in both aquarium and wild contexts will allow us to better understand the biology of this genus, and improve reproduction in captivity. Interpreting ex situ reproductive behaviors of seahorses within various densities reported from natural populations will help us predict the impact of conservation efforts and increase the likelihood of long-term persistence of populations for this threatened genus.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Misra, Anil Kumar; Pachouri, Ankit; Kaur, Amandeep",Watershed Management Structures and Decision Making Frameworks,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,29,13,4849,4861,10.1007/s11269-015-1094-8,Oct-15,2015,"Integrated watershed management has been adopted worldwide as best management practices, can minimise the climate change impact on agricultural production and fresh water resources.

The pottery indicates a wreck date at the time of the emperor Septimius Severus (AD 193-211), and suggests that the other main ports of call were in central Tyrrhenian Italy. This paper focuses on the evidence for amphora production during the period of the Severan dynasty (AD 193-235), when north Africa began to replace south Spain as the main source of long-distance olive oil import to Rome. The two cargo amphora forms, Africana 1 and Africana 2A, were probably respectively for olive oil and fish produce, the latter reflecting a major export industry which developed alongside oil production. Kiln survey shows that these forms were produced in urban and peri-urban manufactories at several east Tunisian port sites, and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, here applied for the first time successfully to a wreck assemblage, indicates that the Plemmairio amphoras were from the area of Sullechtum. The limited morphological variability in the assemblage reflects highly organized production. Wreck evidence greatly improves our understanding of amphora production, not only between the Spanish and the African phases but also in the evolving patterns of African export through the third century AD and beyond which can be related to wider political and economic developments in the middle and late Roman Empire.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Sipauba-Tavares, L.

In the Discovery Bay Special Fishery Conservation Area (DBSFCA) and other marine protected areas in Jamaica, there is a paucity of information on larval fish communities and the factors affecting their diversity and distribution. Therefore, we compared the efficiencies of light traps and plankton nets to assess the richness and composition of ichthyoplankton species in Jamaica's oldest fish sanctuary, the DBSFCA. Min/Max Auto-correlation Factor Analysis (MAFA) and the Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) were then used to compare biotic and abiotic factors that influenced larval fish diversity and distribution. A total of 41 species belonging to 39 families of predominantly reef-associated species were identified during the sampling period of February to November 2014. The plankton net proved to be more efficient, catching 2202 individuals from 36 species, while light traps caught 590 individuals from 15 larval fish species. The plankton nets and light traps collected 27 and seven mutually exclusive species, respectively. From February to July, Clupeidae and Pomacentridae dominated the larvae community and throughout the study period Clupeidae was the most abundant family in the light traps. Blennidae, Gobiidae, Labridae, Labrisomidae, Pomacentridae and Sparidae frequently accounted for less than 50% of the relative abundance. Commercially important families such as Lutjanidae and Haemulidae were rarely caught with both gears. Additionally, temporal changes in the abundance and richness of fish larvae, indicating peak abundance during July and August, were detected with both DFA and MAFA. A DFA model with two common trends and three explanatory variables (mean day-length, mean zooplankton richness and mean monthly sea temperature) was the optimal model for characterizing ichthyoplankton abundance.

Low frequency SPLs associated with fish vocalizations peaked twice per day for some reefs, but showed no relationship with habitat complexity or fish community structure. High frequency SPLs and invertebrate snap rates peaked nightly and were positively correlated with structural rugosity of reefs but not fish community structure. ACI values for both high and low frequency bands showed no associations with habitat complexity or fish community structure.

Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled along with physical and chemical measures of the soil and water from 29 agricultural drainage ditches on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.

In a 1996-1997 dry season experiment, the effects of (1) absence or presence of a fish polyculture, and (2) two different rice-seeding rates (100 and 300 kg pre-germinated rice per ha) on the trench floodwater ecology were studied. Fish were stocked in six out of twelve rice-fish plots at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station (10degrees 10' N and 105degrees 20' E), Silver barb, common carp and Nile tilapia were stocked in polyculture at densities of 3150, 310 and 550 fish/ha,respectively. Several hydrological and biological parameters or the trench floodwater were measured. About 65% of the observed variation in the trench floodwater could be attributed to the Fishes stocked and changes in rice-seeding rate. The presence of a fish polyculture increased the water turbidity of the trench floodwater, mainly through suspension of mineral and organic material through fish perturbation. At the lower rice-seeding rate, this resulted in a lower primary production. Photosynthetic activity, dissolved oxygen am and pill showed significant decreases, but only at the lower rice-seeding rate in the presence of fish. Fish polyculture presence resulted in lower ortho-phosphate concentrations, higher phytoplankton communities and higher Protozoa numbers, most probably due to a higher availability of nutrients through fish defecation and perturbation. The rice-seeding rate had a significant impact on pH am, pH pill and temperature pm readings. The survival rate for Nile tilapia and the gross production for Nile tilapia and common carp was higher at the lower rice seeding, rate, most probably due to a better aquatic environment of the field.

We also evaluated the impact of a hypothetical increase in the exploitation of baitfish and future changes to phytoplankton productivity. The model predicted that rebuilding Gag will cause the biomass of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata to be 20% lower than it is now and those of Black Grouper M. bonaci, King Mackerel Scomberomorus cavalla, and other shallow-water groupers to be 5-10% lower.

Oyster spat are grown to marketable size in rack-and-rail ('racks') or longline-and-basket ('baskets') configurations, which add structure to estuarine waters. This study assessed: (1) how the fish communities associated with oyster farms vary with production method; (2) how communities of fish utilise oyster infrastructure, as compared to adjacent natural habitats; and (3) whether oyster infrastructure can serve as de facto oyster reefs by supporting similar fish communities. Remote underwater video surveys, conducted during summer and winter of 2 study years, revealed that fish observations and species richness were generally greater for rack than basket cultivation. Both types of oyster farms supported at least as many species of fish as adjacent natural habitats, including oyster reef, seagrass, mangrove and bare sediment. Fish communities were, in general, most similar between racks and baskets and most dissimilar between racks and bare sediments. Oyster farms supported species of fish otherwise limited to habitats with wild oysters, and unique harvested fish species were observed more frequently at racks. Fish use of oyster-growing infrastructure for foraging and shelter mirrored use of natural biogenic habitats. Overall, this study suggests that the oyster aquaculture infrastructure can support fish communities with species composition similar to those of natural biogenic habitats, although this service is dependent on farming method.

Ecological restoration and species enhancement projects could be profitably used to test theoretically based predictions, but only if theory were first applied to develop quantitative predictions suitable for testing. Here, we review what is known about factors limiting population size and production of the American lobster Homarus americanus, and use that information to construct a demographic life-table model of population dynamics. We then use the model to evaluate alternative options for enhancing lobster population size and production. Because this species represents an example of a population subjected to intense human exploitation as a target of commercial fisheries, which has stimulated much research on its biology, demographic modeling is facilitated. Furthermore, intervention into the fishery provides a viable restoration option available only to exploited species. We apply the economic concept of discounting (of future pay-back in the form of restoration, analogous to being paid interest on a loan) to allow quantification of the scale of restoration needed to compensate for both the magnitude of the estimated loss of American lobsters and the time lags between loss and restoration following a major oil spill. Quantification of benefits is rarely performed for restoration projects to guide compensation for natural resource damages caused by environmental incidents. The methods and approach developed here can help address this past failure in order to provide compensating ecological and human services equal to those lost. The approach represents a significant step forward in conceptually and quantitatively addressing restoration needs.

Given this situation, establishing artificial habitats (AHs) and marine protected areas (MPAs) is seen as away of both conserving biodiversity and managing fishing activities. AHs have two main effects: (1) they attract fish from the surrounding areas and concentrate them in the AH, and (2) they increase the capacity of the environment, as a result of the installation of new individuals or, in some cases, of new species. MPAs decrease fish accessibility by constraining the spatial distribution of the fishing effort. We have developed a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be used to describe the evolution of fish density, fishing effort, and landings depending on whether AHs are deployed in a MPA or in a fishing area. The analytical study of the ODE system is simplified by means of assuming that processes occur on different time scales. Fish reproduction and landings were assumed to occur at a slow time scale, whereas, fish displacement was assumed to occur at a fast time scale. For both scenarios of AHs implementation (in an MPA or in a fishing area), we show the existence of different equilibria according to hypotheses based on a purely attractive or purely productive effect of the AH. In all cases, the deployment of AHs in the fishing area leads to an equilibrium with lower fish biomass and lower fish landings than when AHs are deployed within the MPA. This suggests that AHs should not be fished in order to maximize long term fish productivity and fish landings in the surrounding areas. In addition, we attempt to establish a correspondence between our theoretical results and the management plan for artisanal fisheries on the Senegalese coast, which includes the implementation of both AHs and MPAs. This suggests that there is not enough coordination between the non-governmental organizations deploying the AHs and the institutions managing MPAs. Indeed, AHs are usually either immersed in an MPA or subject to local fishing ban, but in fact regulation is inadequate. In this context, the deployment of AHs as part of fisheries management would be premature and could have potentially adverse effects on the resource. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Metallographic and chemical analyses on samples from the biggest cargo have determined the stages of the chaine operatoire, identified the properties of the iron and characterized the iron trade along the Israeli coast. The new discoveries contribute to our understanding of the circulation of iron in the South Levant, which was characterized by an almost complete absence of local iron production. During the Byzantine and Crusader periods, this absence was compensated by long-distance sea trade, depending on political circumstances and restrictions. Three main types of iron semi-products were identified: (a) partly consolidated blooms, (b) short pointed bars and (c) elongated pointed bars. The cargoes discovered represent a time period of nearly a millennium. Altogether, 148 iron semi-products were studied. Of these, 166 were from cargo a, which was dated by coins to around 1130-1200 ce. Those coins could have been imported from Europe for Crusader military and civil uses in the Levant.

Research shows that there are many biotic and abiotic factors that affect soil fauna diversity in anthropogenic ecosystems such as paddy fields, and anthropogenic disturbance factors such as planting methods play the most obvious role. Chongming Island is an important agricultural planting area in Shanghai. The influence on ecosystem of rice farming is the focus in the rice production process. At present, although there have been some reports on the community structure and diversity characteristics of soil animals in paddy fields under different planting methods, these studies have not yet covered the three rice planting methods of conventional, organic and ecological (rice-fishing) in the same area. Therefore, the present study investigated the differences in the diversity of small and medium-sized soil animals under three rice cultivation methods. [Methods] This study set up three sample plots, which are all located on Chongming Island. The three plots are mainly cultivated with rice, and their natural vegetation and production background are basically the same. Their farming patterns were conventional planting, organic planting and ecological planting (Table 1). According to different rice growth stages, this study investigated the small and medium-sized soil animals in paddy fields in January, March, June and October, 2020, with a total of 4 samples. Small and medium-sized soil animals were separated by Tullgren method, and one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis H method were used to test the significance of differences. [Results] The results showed that a total of 449 small and medium-sized soil animals were obtained, belonging to 2 phyla, 5 classes, and 8 orders (Table 2). The dominant group was Collembola, accounting for 82.18% of the total catch. Among the three planting methods, Symphyla are only found in the soil of conventional paddy fields, Rosette is only found in the soil of organic paddy fields, and Hemiptera and Orthoptera are only found in the soil of ecological paddy fields. The community structure of small and medium-sized soil animals were significantly different in paddy fields under three planting methods, the density difference of small and medium-sized soil animals in different plots were significant, and the density of organic paddy fields was higher than the others (Fig. 1). The vertical distribution of small and medium-sized soil animal communities showed surface clustering characteristics, and the number and density of groups showed a downward trend (Fig. 2). There was no significant difference in the number of groups of small and medium-sized soil animals in different soil plots. The richness index, diversity index, and evenness index of small and medium-sized soil animals in ecological planting paddy fields were the highest, and the dominance index of organic planting paddy fields was the highest (Fig. 3). Three different planting patterns showed moderate similarity between any two groups. [Conclusion] Compared with conventional and organic planting patterns, ecological planting pattern is more conducive to improving the diversity and evenness of small and medium-sized soil animals and promoting the stability and healthy development of the paddy ecosystem. It is of significance to the sustainability of rice planting and as the indicator of agricultural non-point source pollution.At the same time, there are many factors affecting the community structure of small and medium-sized soil fauna in paddy fields, we suggest that further studies can be performed with the correlation among climate factors, physical and chemical indexes, and soil fauna community.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Morton, Dana N.; Shima, Jeffrey S.",Habitat configuration and availability influences the settlement of temperate reef fishes (Tripterygiidae),JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,449,,215,220,10.1016/j.jembe.2013.09.017,Nov-13,2013,"To survive, most benthic marine organisms must find suitable settlement habitat For reef fishes, settlement habitat is often structurally complex, spatially heterogeneous, and dynamic. Consequently, successful settlement is likely to be determined by an interaction between larval delivery and behavior, habitat availability, and structural characteristics (e.g., configuration) of the habitat itself. We examined the effects of habitat configuration and availability on the settlement of New Zealand triplefins (Tripterygiidae), using a field experiment that comprised three habitat treatments and evaluated effects over naturally varying levels of larval supply. Our results suggest that settler density and total settlement are shaped by both the availability and spatial configuration of habitat patches. Highest total settlement occurred in larger, more clumped habitat patches. Lowest total settlement occurred in more dispersed habitat patches of the same size and smaller isolated patches. The densities of recently settled triplefins were lowest in the dispersed patches, and high in both isolated patches and the clumped patches. We speculate that dispersed patches may comprise a lower quality habitat, and/or provide a weaker settlement trigger for both physical and biological reasons. Clumped patches, on the other hand, may provide a stronger settlement cue via baffling of currents, or may represent a higher quality habitat for recently settled triplefins, triggering higher settlement Our findings indicate that habitat availability can influence abundance of recently settled fish, but the landscape architecture is an equally important determinant of settlement success for triplefins.

In this review, potential consequences for fish stocks and fisheries are evaluated based on available information, and the most critical gaps of knowledge in assessing environmental impacts are identified. A lack of empirical data and scientifically evaluated case studies is recognized. Together with the fact that many commercial species are close to or below biologically secure limits, this makes a strong case for emphasizing efforts to minimize potential negative effects on fish in the establishment of offshore wind farms. 1. Large part of the evaluations presented in this review is based on general ecological knowledge and experiences from other marine activities, rather than from actual wind farms. A critical concern is that only few of the results referred to have been scientifically evaluated.2. The risk for negative effects may in many cases be reduced by technical solutions, and by considering local ecological processes during planning.Monitoring of established wind farms is essential both for increasing knowledge on the effects on fish, and for identifying correct mitigation actions where needed. 3. During the construction stage, a general risk to particularly young life stages of fish is identified. The expected types of impact are similar to those in other marine activities, such as piling and dredging, but the geographical and temporal extent is expected to be higher. I order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in significant recruitment areas, and construction activities should be avoided during critical reproductive seasons. Research should focus on identifying essential fish habitats for purposes of marine planning, and on the development of construction methods that minimize negative effects. 4. During the operational stage, a low level of impact on fish is generally assumed, however the current state of knowledge in this field is poor. The two most critical issues identified are how the introduction of new physical structures affects local ecological community structures, and how the quality of fish recruitment areas is affected by increased noise. In order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in areas that are currently undisturbed by human activities, and in significant recruitment areas. The development of methods that minimize the effects of noise and electromagnetism should be favoured. 5. Off-shore wind farms are associated with restrictions to fishing by reduced access or gear restrictions. This has direct economical consequences for the fishermen affected. In large wind farms, reduced fishing efforts may have a positive effect on the growth of local commercial stocks, provided however that the stocks are not negatively affected by other types of impact from the wind farm. 6. Some fish species may be attracted to the wind farm area and others may avoid it. The catchability of fish is likely to increase in areas where fish is aggregated, which may have to be considered specifically in estimations of local stock sizes and management. 7. Changes in other parts of the ecosystem may have indirect on fish, for example changes in food supply. Ecologically integrated monitoring programs may reveal potential mechanisms behind any observed changes, and support the identification of areas most appropriate for large scale exploitation. 8. The expected level of impact is strongly dependent on local ecological conditions. However, current knowledge on the distribution and function of essential fish habitats in Swedish waters is too low to directly identify geographic areas most appropriate for exploitation. 9. In general, shallow areas have a higher potential value in terms of productivity, and establishment here is associated with a higher level of ecological risk. The current state of knowledge suggests that the risk for negative effects is lowest in areas below 15-20 meters depth, and in areas where the level ofhuman impact is currently high. In such areas, potential positive artificial reef effects are also expected to be highest. The highest level of risk is associated with relatively undisturbed off-shore shallows.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Langlois, Juliette; Freon, Pierre; Steyer, Jean-Philippe; Delgenes, Jean-Philippe; Helias, Arnaud",Sea use impact category in life cycle assessment: characterization factors for life support functions,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT,20,7,970,981,10.1007/s11367-015-0886-7,Jul-15,2015,"The impact of human activities on marine environments is poorly addressed by the scope of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA).

By failing to acknowledge this, maritime archaeologists are restricting their reconstructions of past maritime societies.

Some of these methods focus on the Net Primary Production (NPP) available for ecosystem functioning through the comparison between the Human Appropriated Net Primary Production (HANPP) and the ecosystem's initial NPP at a given reference year. While some approaches have been proposed for marine ecosystems, most of the HANPP studies focus on terrestrial systems. This study highlights the relation between the HANPP methods and the production of natural resources in marine ecosystems. The linkage between current overfishing and future fish provisioning (ecosystem service) is well known. However, less studied before, is the relation between seaweed aquaculture and fish provisioning through the marine food web. Seaweed growth requires nutrients and light that will consequently be no longer available for natural phytoplankton production. As seaweed is periodically harvested, a fraction of the ecosystem's NPP (HANPP) is no longer available for ecosystem production. The HANPP of aquaculture reduces the ecosystem carrying capacity and thus affects commercial fish stocks. Therefore, an integrative approach is proposed in this study to assess the potential effect of seaweed farming on fish landings in the Greater North Sea. Three indicators are proposed to assess the Lost Potential Yield (LPY) in fish landings: LPYB, LPYV and LPYE, accounting respectively for reduction in biomass, monetary value and eco-exergy. For these three aspects, the LPY results remains smaller than the seaweed production, meaning that the overall natural resources balance for seaweed farming is positive.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Vannavong, Nanthasane; Seidu, Razak; Stenstroem, Thor-Axel; Dada, Nsa; Overgaard, Hans J.",Effects of socio-demographic characteristics and household water management on Aedes aegypti production in suburban and rural villages in Laos and Thailand,PARASITES & VECTORS,10,,,,10.1186/s13071-017-2107-7,Apr 4 2017,2017,"Background: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease accounting for 50-100 million annual cases globally. Laos and Thailand are countries in south-east Asia where the disease is endemic in both urban and rural areas. Household water storage containers, which are favourable breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes, are common in these areas, due to intermittent or limited access to water supply. This study assessed the effect of household water management and socio-demographic risk factors on Aedes aegypti infestation of water storage containers.Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 239 households in Laos (124 suburban and 115 rural), and 248 households in Thailand (127 suburban and 121 rural) was conducted. Entomological surveys alongside semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted to obtain information on Ae. aegypti infestation, socio-demographic factors and water management. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to assess risk factors associated with Ae. aegypti pupal infestation.Results: Household water management rather than socio-demographic factors were more likely to be associated with the infestation of water containers with Ae. aegypti pupae. Factors that was significantly associated with Ae. aegypti infestation were tanks, less frequent cleaning of containers, containers without lids, and containers located outdoors or in toilets/ bathrooms.Conclusions: Associations between Ae. aegypti pupae infestation, household water management, and socio-demographic factors were found, with risk factors for Ae. aegypti infestation being specific to each study setting. Most of the containers did not have lids, larvicides, such as temephos was seldom used, and containers were not cleaned regularly; factors are facilitating dengue vector proliferation. It is recommended that, in Lao villages, health messages should promote proper use and maintenance of tightly fitted lids, and temephos in tanks, which were the most infested containers. Recommendations for Thailand are that small water containers should be cleaned weekly. Furthermore, in addition to health messages on dengue control provided to communities, attention should be paid to larval control for indoor containers in rural villages. Temephos or other immature control measures such as the use of pyriproxyfen, antilarval bacteria, or larvivorous fish should be used where temephos resistance is prevalent.

The artificial substrate called artificial rubble (AR) consisted of two 10 X 10 X 3 cm fireproof bricks which were stacked and tied with thick fishing lines. Five replicates of the AR were placed at each of five experimental sites in coral reef-associated environments off Ishigaki Island (Okinawa, Japan) in mid-April, 1999. Ten weeks later, the fishing lines were carefully cut underwater using a knife, and the upper and lower sections of the AR were recovered separately. Comparisons of live larger foraminiferal abundances on natural reef rubble versus AR showed that mean densities of amphisteginids, calcarinids and nummulitids on AR were generally an order of magnitude lower than those on natural reef rubble, which ranged from <10(2) to >10(3) individuals per 100 cm(2) of bottom. On the other hand, mean densities of peneroplids and soritids on AR were comparable with those on natural reef rubble, suggesting that these taxa are the most efficient colonizers, at least during the experimental period. Analysis of foraminiferal abundances on the upper versus lower sections of AR revealed that live larger foraminifera were more common on the upper than lower section in shallow-water environments (<6 m depth), whereas they were more common on the lower section in reef slope environments; the difference was statistically significant only at a moat (shallow lagoon) site (alpha = 0.05). Peneroplids, soritids and reef flat-dwelling calcarinids were always more common on the upper than lower section. Particularly at the moat site, Peneroplis antillarum, P planatus, Sorites orbiculus and Neorotalia calcar were significantly more abundant on the upper section (alpha = 0.05). In contrast, amphisteginids, nummulitids and reef slope-dwelling calcarinids were consistently more common on the lower section, although their abundances were patchy and highly variable. Individuals of Amphistegina radiata and Heterostegina depressa were uncommon on upper sections (<20% of those encountered), and that difference was significant for A. radiata at a 30-m-deep reef slope site (alpha = 0.05). The prevalence of each taxon of larger foraminifera on either the upper or lower section of AR is possibly related to positive phototaxis, adaptation to high light, mechanisms for attachment, cryptic behavior, and epiphytization on experimental substrates.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Hickford, Michael J.

In New Zealand, one consequence has been a reduction in the obligate riparian spawning habitat of Galaxias maculatus. This diadromous species forms the basis of an important fishery where juveniles are caught as they migrate into freshwater. Spawning success of G. maculatus is closely associated with the nature of available riparian habitat. We used a field experiment in a rural stream to test whether livestock grazing limits egg production and whether there is a lag in increased egg production after protection from grazing because of the recovery time of riparian vegetation. In a separate experiment in an urban stream we tested whether improved riparian management can increase egg production. Livestock exclusion produced an immediate and long-lasting increase in the height and density of riparian vegetation with reduced fluctuations in the ground-level physical environment, and positive changes to the density and survival of eggs. After 4years, egg densities in exclosures were 400 times greater than in grazed controls and egg survival had doubled. Mowing riparian vegetation 2months prior to spawning reduced egg densities by 75% and survival by 25%. Our experiments showed that altering grazing and mowing in spawning sites produced dense riparian vegetation, that this improved the microsite environment and resulted in greatly increased egg deposition and survival over several years. This clearly indicates that the single most effective step in rehabilitating G. maculatus spawning habitat is a simple reduction in grazing/mowing pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Theuerkauf, Seth J.; Puckett, Brandon J.; Eggleston, David B.","Metapopulation dynamics of oysters: sources, sinks, and implications for conservation and restoration",ECOSPHERE,12,7,,,10.1002/ecs2.3573,Jul-21,2021,"Metapopulation and source-sink dynamics are increasingly considered within spatially explicit management of wildlife populations, yet the application of these concepts has generally been limited to comparisons of the performance (e.g., demographic rates or dispersal) inside vs. outside protected areas, and at spatial scales that do not encompass an entire metapopulation. In the present study, a spatially explicit, size-structured matrix model was applied to simulate the dynamics of an Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) metapopulation in the second largest estuary in the United States-the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System in North Carolina. The model integrated larval dispersal simulations with empirical measures of oyster demographic rates to simulate the dynamics of the entire oyster metapopulation consisting of 646 reefs and five reef types: (1) restored subtidal reefs closed to harvest (i.e., sanctuaries or protected areas; n = 14), (2) restored subtidal reefs open to harvest (n = 53), (3) natural subtidal reefs open to harvest (n = 301), (4) natural intertidal reefs open to harvest (n = 129), and (5) oyster reefs on manmade, hard structures such as seawalls (n = 149). Key findings included (1) an overall stable, yet slightly declining oyster metapopulation, (2) variable reef type-specific population trajectories, largely dependent on spatiotemporal variation in larval recruitment, (3) a greater relative importance of inter-reef larval connectivity on metapopulation dynamics than local larval retention processes, and (4) spatiotemporal variation in the source-sink status of reef subpopulations wherein subtidal sanctuaries and reefs located in the northeastern portion of the estuary were frequent sources. From a management perspective, continued protection of oyster sanctuaries is warranted. Sanctuaries represented only 6.2% of the total reef area, however, they harbored 19% (+/- 2%) of all oysters and produced 25% (+/- 6%) of all larvae settling within the metapopulation. Additional management priorities should focus on restoration or conservation of subpopulations that serve as frequent source subpopulations (including those with poor demographic rates, but high connectivity potential), and management of harvest from sink subpopulations.

Concurrent with the addition of nutrients via municipal, industrial, and agricultural sources, widespread consumer exploitation is changing consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics drastically. Thus, altered nutrient dynamics can occur through changes in the supply of multiple nutrients, as well as through changes in the sources of these nutrients. Seagrass ecosystems are heavily impacted by human activities, with highly altered nutrient dynamics from multiple causes. We simulate scenarios of altered nutrient supply and ratios, nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P), from two nutrient sources in seagrass ecosystems: anthropogenic fertilizer and fish excretion. In doing so we tested expectations rooted in ecological theory that suggest the importance of resource dynamics for predicting primary producer dynamics. Ecosystem functions were strongly altered by artificial fertilizer (e.g., seagrass growth increased by as much as 140%), whereas plant/algae community structure was most affected by fish-mediated nutrients or the interaction of both treatments (e.g., evenness increased by similar to 140% under conditions of low fish nutrients and high anthropogenic nutrients). Interactions between the nutrient sources were found for only two of six response variables, and the ratio of nutrient supply was the best predictor for only one response. These findings show that seagrass structure and function are well predicted by supply of a single nutrient (either N or P). Importantly, no single nutrient best explained the majority of responsesmeasures of community structure were best explained by the primary limiting nutrient to this system (P), whereas measures of growth and density of the dominant producer in the system were best explained by N.

We created species distribution models for 21 species of commercial, recreational, ecological, or conservation importance within the Southern California Bight based on observations from long-term reef surveys combined with high resolution (200 m x 200 m) geospatial environmental data layers. We then combined the individual species models to create a stacked-species habitat suitability map, identifying over 800 km(2) of potential area for reef restoration within the Bight.

We used a long-term (10 month) in situ experiment with two phylogenetically diverse scleractinians (Acropora palmataandPorites porites) to test how coral-symbiotic algal interactions changed under real-world conditions that were a priori expected to be beneficial (fish-mediated nutrients) and to be harmful, but non-lethal, for coral (fish + anthropogenic nutrients). Analyzing nine response variables of nutrient stoichiometry and stable isotopes per coral fragment, we found that nutrients from fish positively affected coral growth, and moderate doses of anthropogenic nutrients had no additional effects. While growing, coral maintained homeostasis in their nutrient pools, showing tolerance to the different nutrient regimes. Nonetheless, structural equation models revealed more nuanced relationships, showing that anthropogenic nutrients reduced the diversity of coral-symbiotic algal interactions and caused nutrient and carbon flow to be dominated by the symbiont. Our findings show that nutrient and carbon pathways are fundamentally rewired under anthropogenic nutrient regimes in ways that could increase corals' susceptibility to further stressors. We hypothesize that our experiment captured coral in a previously unrecognized transition state between mutualism and antagonism. These findings highlight a notable parallel between how anthropogenic nutrients promote symbiont dominance with the holobiont, and how they promote macroalgal dominance at the coral reef scale. Our findings suggest more realistic experimental conditions, including studies across gradients of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment as well as the incorporation of varied nutrient and energy pathways, may facilitate conservation efforts to mitigate coral loss.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Thomas, Keith; Ironside, Kayleigh; Clark, Lisa; Bingle, Lewis",Preliminary microbiological and chemical analysis of two historical stock ales from Victorian and Edwardian brewing,JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF BREWING,127,2,167,175,10.1002/jib.641,2021,2021,"Historical beers are a valuable source of information on past brewing microbiology providing opportunity for analysis and isolation. Although rarely found intact and suffering variable degrees of deterioration they can contain living microbial cells and residues of chemical components indicating the character of the beers and their production processes. This report summarises preliminary analysis of two beers from Victorian and Edwardian times and provides an indication of their chemistry and microbiology. One beer, recovered from the 1895 Scottish shipwreck Wallachia, was a 7.5% ABV stout, the other an 11% ABV celebration King's Ale, a barley wine, brewed by Bass in 1902 for the visit of King Edward VII. Live yeast was isolated from both beers: Brettanomyces and Debaryomyces from the Wallachia stout and Saccharomyces from the Bass Ale. Ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing indicated the presence of a wide range of microorganisms in both beers including lactobacilli and pediococci in the Wallachia beer and staphylococci in the Bass Ale. Both beers are likely to be in the category of stock ales of the time and would have been matured for a period before bottling. The presence of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in both beers confirms the understanding of this species as an important contributor to these beers but it is also interesting that Debaryomyces species are consistently present as a major component and that Saccharomyces are less prevalent.

The three species of interest inhabit different marine habitats at different life stages, and therefore can have significant influences across the sea floor at broad spatial scales. The primary species include the shallow-water Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), which inhabits mangrove root systems as juveniles, and caves, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs as adults; red grouper (E. morio), which excavates habitat throughout its benthic life in Karst regions of the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic, from the coast to the shelf-edge; and tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), a species that lives on the continental slope and constructs elaborate, pueblo-esque burrows. The anthropogenic disturbances of greatest interest in the Gulf of Mexico include fishing, hypoxia, red tide, oil and gas exploration, and climatic change. We suggest that to understand the broader effects of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on biomass and productivity in these species requires that we first understand the strength of interactions between them and the other species residing within their communities (e.g., predators, prey, commensals, and mutualists).",,,,,,,,,,,J,"BECK, MW",SIZE-SPECIFIC SHELTER LIMITATION IN STONE CRABS - A TEST OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC BOTTLENECK HYPOTHESIS,ECOLOGY,76,3,968,980,10.2307/1939360,Apr-95,1995,"Habitat structural complexity can facilitate species persistence by providing refuges and the availability of refuges may control the size of many populations. In organisms that increase greatly in size during ontogeny the size and abundance of refuges is particularly important, because population-regulating factors may operate strongly on only one size class or ontogenetic stage within a population, creating a demographic bottleneck. I test the demographic bottleneck hypothesis in stone crabs by first supplementing shelter with five different sizes of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe at eight sites in St. Joseph Bay, Florida to determine the size class most likely to be shelter limited. I then used tethering experiments, cage studies, and natural observations to ask if habitat structural complexity regulates the stone crab population through its size-specific effects on growth, survival, and fecundity.Shelter availability appears to create a demographic bottleneck that affects the growth and fecundity of large crabs. In both 1991 and 1992, and largest PVC pipes were occupied in significantly greater proportions than smaller pipes, suggesting that this shelter size class is limiting. Predation is size specific; smaller individuals are at significant risk but no large crabs were taken by predators. However, shelter is particularly important for the growth of large crabs. There was a fivefold increase in molting individuals on shelter-supplemented sites relative to natural densities suggesting that the bottleneck size class has been identified correctly and that shelter additions can alleviate the bottleneck. Supplemental shelters also particularly attracted gravid females and, in tethering experiments, females with shelter produce egg masses twice as quickly as females without shelter. These results differ from most prior results in marine populations in two ways. First, it is factors affecting adults and not juveniles that may regulate the stone crab populations. Second, refuge use in those size classes likely to be shelter limited is not explained primarily by predation, but by effects on growth and fecundity. The evidence suggests the merits of the demographic bottleneck hypothesis; habitat structural complexity may affect both the size of populations and the size of individuals within the population.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Lougas, Lembi; Blauer, Auli",Detecting Medieval Foodways in the North-eastern Baltic: Fish Consumption and Trade in Towns and Monasteries of Finland and Estonia,ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY,26,6,543,554,10.1080/14614103.2020.1758993,Nov 2 2021,2021,"Lembi Lougas is a research track associate professor at the Tallinn University and the head of the Archaeological Research Collection department.

P.",Major modifications of the Black Sea benthic and planktonic biota in the last three decades,Bulletin de l'Institut Oceanographique (Monaco),0,SPEC. ISSUE 15,85,110,,1995,1995,"During the last three decades, increasing eutrophication and other manmade activities have considerably changed the structure and functioning of the Black Sea ecosystems, mainly in its NW comer, affecting both the qualitative and the quantitative state of the benthic and planktonic communities. Marked changes have been registered especially in the structure of littoral ecosystems. The macrophytobenthos has shown a gradual but continuous decline, approximately since 1945-1950, due to both natural (e.g. occasional massive frosts) and anthropogenic factors (silting of the rocky bottom, increased turbidity, diminution of light penetration). The previously large belts of Cystoseira barbata, a perennial brown alga, along the western coast have practically disappeared as have numerous other associated and/or epiphytic algal and animal species. The present algal flora, which displays a reduced species diversity, is uniform. Generally it is dominated by Enteromorpha intestinalis, E. linza, Ceramium elegans and C. arborescens. These newly dominant species with short and nearly seasonal life cycles show considerable production but, nevertheless, they do not reach the levels attained by Cystoseira during previous decades. The evolution of zoobenthos communities is marked by a qualitative impoverishment, expressed by a 50 to 60% reduction of species number since the 1960s, and by the decline in density of the numerous populations formerly omnipresent. Thus species which were prevailing and characteristic formerly (Spio filicornis, Corbula mediterranea, Syndesmia fragilis, Spisula subtruncata, Mytilus galloprovincialis) have given place to fewer opportunistic species (Neanthes succinea, Polydora limicola, Melinna palmata, Mya arenaria, Scapharca inaequivalvis) which have proliferated. The resulting population increases did not compensate however for the reduction of general biomass and density, which are lower by 35-84% than those measured 25 years ago. While zoobenthic communities have become more and more homogeneous as a result of mass proliferation of a few species, their structure is now more unstable owing to the permanent disturbance generated by blooms and related benthic mass mortalities. Due to intense eutrophication phytoplankton biomass surpasses that of the past. Some essential structural changes have occurred and new quantitative and qualitative characteristics have been recorded. The increase of the amplitude and frequency of algal blooms is a significant ecological consequence of the accumulation of nutrients in sea water. Since 1970, blooms are no longer exceptional phenomena. For example, in the 1980's alone, 46 blooms due to 15 algal species were recorded in the Romanian littoral waters. Besides the bloom-producing species, other numerous mass species have remarkably developed. During the 1980's, 79 species recorded densities larger than 100,000 cells l-1, as compared to 57 species in the 1970's, and only 38 species in the 1960's. Numerical density of the main species increased from the levels of the 1960's, for 66% of the species in the 1970's, and for 78% of the species in the 1980's. From the 1960's to the 1980's the proportion of non-diatoms in the numerical density of phytoplankton increased from 8% to 62% of the total. Changes in the quantitative proportions of the main algal groups are due to the changes in the nutritive basis. These changes include the diminution of the ratios Si:N and Si:P (which is detrimental to diatoms), and the increase of organic matter (which favors the phytoplankters with mixotrophic affinities belonging to Dinoflagellata, Euglenida, and Chrysophyta). Between 1983 and 1990 the average biomass of phytoplankton in Romanian coastal waters was more than 8 times higher than that assessed between 1959 and 1963. The evolution of the zooplankton communities was marked by a simplification of structure and a diminution of species diversity, especially in the shore areas. Besides the total disappearance of some species (three species of copepods belonging to the family Pontellidae), the populations of some holoplanktonic species have diminished greatly, as for example Centropages kroyeri, Penilia avirostris, Evadne tergestina and E. spinifera. The populations of the meroplanktonic component of the zooplankton (the planktonic larval stages of benthic biota) have also diminished as a consequence of the mortalities produced in the benthic fauna. In contrast the density of a small number of opportunistic species (e.g. Acartia clausi and Pleopis polyphemoides) increased, the species becoming dominant in the communities. Another characteristic feature is the explosive development of Noctiluca scintillans, especially during the summer, following a significant algal bloom (in the summer of 1986 and 1987, this species represented 91-99% of the entire zooplankton biomass). Massive accumulation of the jellyfish Aurelia aurita has also been recorded. Between 1980 and 1987 the mean values of density and biomass of total zooplankton increased up to 10 times compared to those recorded in the decade 1960-1970, because of massive stocks of Noctiluca in the summer. The trophic zooplankton experienced a substantial decline of the population (especially during 1990-1991) and a decrease of planktivorous fish, concomitently with the appearance in the Black Sea waters of Mnemiopsis leidyi (a big consumer of plankton and fish juveniles). For the ecosystem components of the Black Sea as a whole, the strong relation between the dynamics of the structure of biocoenoses with space and time, as well as the variable character of dynamic processes at community level, became obvious during the last thirty years. The number of bottom fish inhabiting the shallow coastal water sharply declined because of hypoxia. Pelagic fish have also undergone changes in the last two or three decades. Changes in the Black Sea ecosystem were reflected in the taxonomic composition of commercial catches. Three species of dolphins inhabit the Black Sea. At present all riparian countries restrain from catching these marine mammals. Despite these measures, however, dolphin standing stocks have continued to decline.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Asmus, H; Asmus, R",Material exchange and food web of seagrass beds in the Sylt-Romo Bight: how significant are community changes at the ecosystem level?,HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH,54,3-Feb,137,150,10.1007/s101520050012,2000,2000,"Material exchange, biodiversity and trophic transfer within the food web were investigated in two different types of intertidal seagrass beds: a sheltered, dense Zostera marina bed and a more exposed, sparse Z. noltii bed, in the Northern Wadden Sea. Both types of Zostera beds show a seasonal development of aboveground biomass, and therefore measurements were carried out during the vegetation period in summer. The exchange of particles and nutrients between seagrass beds and the overlying water was measured directly using an in situ flume. Particle sedimentation [carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) constituents] from the water column prevailed in dense seagrass beds. In the sheltered, dense seagrass bed, a net particle uptake was found even on windy days (7-8 Beaufort). Dissolved inorganic N and orthophosphate were mainly taken up by the dense seagrass bed. At times of strong winds, nutrients were released from the benthic community to tidal waters. In a budget calculation of total N and total P, the dense seagrass beds were characterised as a material sink. The seagrass beds with sparse Z. noltii were a source of particles even during calm weather. The uptake of dissolved inorganic N in the sparse seagrass bed was low but significant, while the uptake of inorganic phosphate and silicate by seagrasses and their epiphytes was exceeded by release processes from the sediment into the overlying water. Estimates at the ecosystem level showed that material fluxes of seagrass bells in the Sylt-Romo Eight are dominated by the dense type of Zostera beds. Therefore, seagrass beds act as a sink for particles and for dissolved inorganic nutrients. During storms, seagrass beds are distinct sources for inorganic nutrients. The total intertidal area of the Sylt-Romo Eight could be described as a sink for particles and a source for dissolved nutrients. This balance of the material budget was estimated by either including or excluding seagrass beds. Including the subtidal part, the function of the ecosystem as a source for particles increased, supposing that all seagrass beds were lost from the area. During the vegetation period, seagrass beds act as a storage compartment for material accumulated in the living biomass of the community. There was great biodiversity among the plant and animal groups found in intertidal seagrass beds of the Sylt-Romo Bay, representing 50-86% of the total number of species investigated, depending on the particular group. Since most species are not exclusively seagrass residents, the loss of intertidal seagrass beds would be of minor importance for biodiversity at the ecosystem level. Food web structure in seagrass beds is different from other intertidal communities. Primary production and detritus input is high, but secondary production is similar to that of unvegetated areas, although the relative importance of the trophic guilds is different. The loss of seagrass beds leads to profound alterations in the food web of the total ecosystem. Historical as well as recent changes in material fluxes and energy flow due to manmade alterations to the ecosystem are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,J,민병훈,Asian Art Collections and Exhibition in Korea,MISULJARYO,82,,155,190,,2012,2012,"1. Introduction There has been a strong tendency to view pre-modern Korean culture exclusively as part of a larger East Asian culture encompassing China and Japan, tied together by Confucianism,Buddhism, and Chinese characters. This emphasis on Chinese culture is not surprising when we consider Korea's close relationship with China in the development of Korea's culture and history. Such a strong emphasis on China, however, has often resulted in a distorted view that overlooks the diverse cultures coexisting in the history of Asia.Asia is highly divergent both historically and geographically. Because race, language, and religion vary widely across regions, it is more difficult to develop a comprehensive view of Asian history and culture.Fortunately, the recent establishment of academic associations devoted to the study of Asian culture and history has led to the development of scholarships based on primary textual and archaeological sources recorded in the local language, bringing a more balanced view to the understanding of Asian culture.One of the most effective ways to present Asia's cultural diversity for the public would be to explain it through cultural artifacts that contain information about the history and culture in which they were produced. International relations have played a part in creating public knowledge alongside the increasing number of specialists from academic institutions. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of China and the post-Soviet states in Central Asia in the early 1990s brought about a renewed interest in the cultures of these regions. Public museums in Korea were able to establish relationships with Chinese museums and introduce the rich regional traditions of China, providing us with an opportunity to systematically study a wide array of regional cultures including those of Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Yunnan, Tibet, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The recent opening of the Asian galleries at the National Museum of Korea, in conjunction with its new building in Yongsan, Seoul, in October 2005, expedited the process even further. The establishment of a separate department of Asian art reflected the museum's intention to display the diverse cultural interactions with surrounding cultures in Korean culture and history through permanent and special exhibitions. It would bring a more systematic understanding of the diverse cultural histories coexisting in Asia and a broader view of Korean culture in the context of cultural interactions.The new Asian galleries at the National Museum of Korea in Yongsan, mark the first specialized Asian galleries in the museum's history. It is also worth noting that specialists for each gallery were consulted well in advance to ensure efficient preparations for the opening.The Asian galleries include Central Asia, Japan, China, South and Southeast Asia, and the Sinan Shipwreck Collection.2. Asian Art Collections in Korea 1) The National Museum of Korea (1) The Central Asian Collection In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Central Asia became the arena for competition between western powers. Russia, Britain, Sweden, Germany and France all rushed to the region, sending out expeditions to collect information useful for political and military purposes.However, when ancient texts and artifacts of great academic value began to be excavated in the desert area of the Tarim Basin and came to be of academic value, the nature of the expeditions gradually changed to become academic researches on the region's geography and history.Otani Kozui, the 22nd Abbot of the Nishihonganji sect in Kyoto, was in London when the race to excavate in Central Asia began. On his way back to Japan, Otani personally explored western China, and later financed two archaeological expeditions to Central Asia. The research conducted by the Otani Expedition between 1902 and 1914 were published in detail in Illustrated Archaeological Study of the Western Regions (Seiiki Ko –ko Zufu, 1915). But because his expeditions were personally funded, unlike the government-sponsored Western expeditions,Otani soon found himself in the middle of a financial crisis and was forced to abdicate. This led the wide range of objects collected during Otani's expeditions to be scattered in different locations, even before they were labeled and studied.The artifacts that remained with Kozui during his exile in China were housed in Lushun Museum, Dalian, China. The rest were sent to the National Museum in Tokyo and the Joseon Government-General Museum in Seoul. The collection was given to the Joseon Government-General Museum in 1916 and continued to be on display at Sujeong-jeon in Gyeongbokgung Palace until Korea's independence. The Otani collection in Seoul consists of 2,000 objects,including wall paintings from cave temples, everyday objects from the oasis cultures in Central Asia, and burial objects. The museum managed to secure the collection safely during the Korean War.(2) Modern Japanese Art The National Museum of Korea has 198 Japanese modern art works that were collected during the Japanese occupation. They include 93 Japanese-style paintings, 37 western-style paintings, 4 prints, 20 sculptures, and 44 craft objects. In 1938 the Japanese colonial government moved the Yi Royal Household Museum in Changkyeonggung Palace to a newly built art museum building located in Deoksugung Palace. The Seokjo-jeon hall in Deoksugung Palace had been the venue for exhibitions of modern Japanese art since 1933; these were merged with the collections at the Yi Royal Household Museum to be housed in the new Yi Royal Household General Art Museum. Until Korea's independence in 1945, the Japanese colonial government strategically purchased and exhibited Japanese art in order to display the superiority of Japanese art to the Korean art world and audience.Like the Central Asian collection, these works of modern Japanese art stayed in the National Museum collection after the Japanese withdrew from Korea in 1945. Because most of the Japanese artworks housed in the National Museum were winners of major art competitions in Japan from the 1930s to the early 1940s, they include famous names from modern Japanese art history. They have been preserved remarkably well because strong anti-Japanese sentiments after the independence prevented these works from being displayed in public. The craft objects in particular are noteworthy because there are no contemporary craft objects in Japanese collections. These works are from the transitional period when Japanese artists were striving to incorporate the modern with the traditional; these works also serve as important time capsules for studying Japanese art history.(3) Sinan Shipwreck Collection The Silk Road played an important role as the path of trade and cultural transmissions across the Eurasian continent. The maritime Silk Road routes (sea route) compensated the land Silk Road routes (oasis route). The sea route is often called the Ceramic Road, as the development in shipbuilding and navigation technologies allowed large bulks of ceramic wares to be transported over the sea. Dynamic trade activities along the sea route from China to the Islamic empires in Western Asia extended even to Korea and Japan via Southeast Asia and the southeastern coast of China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).In 1323, an international trade vessel, loaded with various trade goods including ceramics, departed from the port of Ningbo in China. On its way to Kyoto, however, it sank in the coastal waters of Sinan, Jeollanamdo, Korea. In 1975, the discovery of a celadon vase by a local fisherman led to the ship's excavation.The excavation of the ship, now called Sinan-sun after its location, was the first underwater archaeology project to be executed in Korea. The discovery of the ship raised increased interest in the international exchanges that took place along the sea trade routes, and more underwater excavation projects were conducted near the Wando, Doripo, Biando, and Taeanbando islands in Korea. With the discovery of Sinan-sun, the sea trade routes in East Asia could now be understood in the larger framework of a pan-Asian network. The artifacts found in the ship provide important evidence for understanding the trade and everyday life along the maritime Silk Road.Underwater excavations were conducted eleven times during the period of nine years from 1976 to 1984. 22,000 ceramic and other objects, 28 tons of coins, 1,000 rosewood objects,and fragments of the ship were excavated. 60% of the ceramics were Longquan wares from the Zhejian Province in China, followed by those made in Jingdezhen, Cizhou, and Jun.(4) Kaneko Kazushige Collection The Southeast Asian collection was one of the National Museum's weakest collections. In accordance with the opening of the new building in 2005, however, the museum was able to acquire an important collection from Kaneko Kazushige, who donated to the museum 1,020objects he had collected in Asia for the past 40 years.Kaneko had spent all his life traveling in Asia, conducting researches and collecting works of various cultures. To prevent his collection from being dispersed and to ensure their conservation, researches and exhibitions, he decided to donate the entire collection to a single museum that could represent a nation; the National Museum of Korea was chosen.The objects in the Kaneko Kazushige collection can be traced to over 30 countries in East Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The wide range of objects include archaeological objects (prehistoric earthenware, bronze, and glass), Buddhist sculptures and paintings, texts, ritual objects, ceramics, lacquerware, woodwork, textiles, bamboo objects,clothing, everyday ceramics, toys, dolls, masks, and musical instruments.2) Private Museum Collection and Exhibition (1) The Tibetan Collection at Hwajung Museum The Tibetan thangka, or Buddhist painting, is commonly found in collections outside of Tibet because of its portability; during historical events that threatened the production of religious art, the Cultural Revolution for example, many paintings were taken out of China.Most of them ended up in European and North American collections, but Kwang-ho Hahn, the founder of the Hahn Cultural Foundation in Korea, became fascinated by Tibetan art after a chance encounter. Since then, he has devoted his life to collecting Tibetan art. The Hahn collection has been expanding every year; the number of objects belonging to the collection reached 900 objects in 2000, making it one of the strongest Tibetan art collections in the world.The Hahn collection includes mandalas, which were central to the practice of Tibetan Esoteric Buddhism, as well as images of Maitreya, Bodhisattva, Idam, Mahakala, Dharmapala, and Arhats, all valuable both in terms of history and iconography.The Tibetan objects from the Hahn collection are now housed in Hwajeong Museum,which is located in the northern part of Seoul in Pyeongchang-dong. Specialist curators are in charge of surveying and researching the collection, as well as planning the museum's annual public exhibitions on Tibetan art. Hwajeong Museum has also been actively engaged in publishing the collection, beginning with Art of Tibet, the museum's opening exhibition catalog published in 1999. The Art of Thangka, an annual report on the museum's collection, has reached its sixth volume (published in 2012) since its first publication in 1997. (The Art of Thangka from Hahn's Collection, vols. 1-6, Seoul: Hahn Cultural Foundation, 1991-2012).(2) Other Collection In addition to its excellent collection of Tibetan art, Hwajeong Museum houses works of calligraphy, paintings and ceramics from the Ming and Qing periods. The museum also holds a large collection of Ming and Qing decorative arts such as metalwork, ivory and wooden sculptures, lacquerware, and jade objects, providing important documents of everyday life and culture during the Ming and Qing periods (Chinese Art Collection of the Hahn Cultural Foundation, vols. 1-2, Seoul: Hahn Cultural Foundation, 2000).Yoogeum Museum, located in Jongno-gu Buam was opened in 2008 as one of the specialized museums that mainly collect Korean and Chinese ancient roof-end tiles. Yu Changjong and Kum Gi-sook's lifelong collection of 1,873 pieces of roof-end tiles and tile, from East Asia and Southeast Asia, was donated to the National Museum of Korea in September 2002. A special exhibition of Gift of Yu Chang-jong's roof-end tile and tile was held in December 2002 to honor the donators. 392 pieces were introduced, including 132 roof-end tiles from China and 21 from Japan and Southeast Asia.Indian Art Museum was opened in July1, 2011 by Kim Yang-sik, a poet and also a renowned researcher of Tagore. Thousands of pieces were collected including sculpture, crafts,and musical instrument, etc. In September 2012, as a celebration of museum's one year anniversary, The Gods of India was held as a special exhibition. In addition, the Indian Art Museum Collection of 180 representative pieces was published.Above this, Woodblock Prints Museum located in Chiak Mountain, Wonju, houses over 3500 antique pieces related to woodblock prints from Korea, China, Japan, and Tibet,Mongolia, India and Nepal. The museum holds various cultural events such as special exhibition and symposium.3. Asian Art Exhibitions in Korea As I have noted above, active scholarly and cultural interactions between the National Museum of Korea and other public museums, as well as between the National Museum and provincial museums in China, have taken place since Korea established diplomatic ties with China in 1992. This has led to many special exhibitions on varying themes from Chinese history and culture.These exhibitions have enabled us to focus on the regional diversities developed from the various cultural and natural climates in China, including the north, south, and the arid region of the northwest, and to better understand the diverse cultures and peoples that constitute Chinese culture.Similarly, the normalization of diplomatic relations with Russia and the new establishment of diplomatic ties with the former Soviet republics in Central Asia have led to more active cultural exchanges. Related exhibitions have opened at the National Museum of Korea, and a training program for specialists has been initiated in order to conserve and manage more effectively the archaeological sites and artifacts found along the Central Asian Silk Road.As the National Museum of Korea began to operate its newly established Asian galleries,collaborative exchanges with museums outside of Korea helped to compensate for the museum's relatively weak Southeast Asian collections and more effectively introduce Southeast Asian culture to the Korean audience. Art of Indonesia, the result of such collaborative efforts, was on view for two years after the opening of the new museum building in 2005 and provided an overview of Indonesian history and culture. The following exhibition Vietnam: Life and Culture was another collaborative project, and was on view from March 2008 to January 2010.The two exhibitions mentioned above can be seen as part of cultural exchange programs between nations. Other exhibitions of varying nature show the recent tendencies in Asian art exhibitions in Korea: while special exhibitions on certain cultural regions have concentrated on introducing each of the diverse cultures that have coexisted in Asia, some have taken a holistic approach, focusing on cultural interactions in Asia and the link between the East and West.Such proliferation of exhibitions focusing on the cultural interactions between the East and West can be seen as one of the recent efforts to overcome the side effects of studies or exhibitions based on a narrow understanding of Korean culture.4. Conclusion In 1990s, Korea established full-scale diplomatic relations with countries in communist bloc such as Russia and China, and at this point, specific cultural exchanges such as related exhibition of cultural property began to revitalize. It is true that within past 20 years these efforts left remarkable results. And around this point, collections on a specific topic or regional culture of Asia seem to begin in earnest before and after this point.In addition, in this period, our national power has risen rapidly which brought a time when we introduced collections from foreign, distinguished museums. And through this process, not only the objects from Asian museums, but also cultural properties taken out by the Western powers around the beginning of the 20th century were recognized.Part of such tendency is due to criticism on the Chinese-oriented academic imbalance in the domestic oriental studies, as well as Asian art history. Scholars of academy and museums have now begun to expand their interest to the historically and geographically diverse world of Asian cultures, which is also in following the wishes of general civilians. This has resulted in many Asian art-exhibitions, held under various topics, helping to shed light on the colorful world of Asian cultures, people, and religion.Moreover, these special exhibitions of Asian art, held in cooperation with various Asian countries, have naturally contributed in increasing the number of international exhibitions of our own cultural heritage. This has opened new doors for cultural exchange and some attempts at bilateral exhibitions based on a full-scale exchange. One collateral benefit was that, through exchange of personnel and academic data among professionals, we have also been successful in creating people's network with the other Asian countries.Recently, curators from not only the best museums in Asia but also from those in South America and East European countries are actively approaching us with proposals for bilateral exhibitions. Some of the representative museums in the west are planning large-scale exhibitions of Korean art and some are asking for our assistance in renovating their existing Korean collection for a more effective exhibition.However, with all the short-term success we have enjoyed so far, there are still many problems left to be solved, including bettering collection quality and incorporating more diversity in special exhibitions. It is true that Koreans are holding a prejudice against Islams in all fields, including education and mass communication. In fact, few attempts are made today in order to systematically understand the Islamic cultures.Therefore, in order to establish a systematic understanding of the local cultures, including those of west, South Asia and the northern nomadic tribes, we need to be more active in promoting cultural exchange with these regions through exhibition events. In addition, we need to nurture more specialists on these regions and actively build research archives based on joint investigations. More emphasis should be laid in holding special exhibitions which reflect research results based on such fundamental studies.We, in our present situation, are bound by cultural prejudices and our Asian art collection may provide a solution to overcome our narrow views on culture. However, our collection is still too heavily focused on a few local areas. Another problem is that the level of quality of our collection is far from being balanced.Studying and appreciating Asian arts offers not only a key to understanding the various forms of life and culture of these people but also an important chance to grossly re-estimate our own culture.Recently it is becoming increasingly difficult to approach foreign cultural artifacts.Therefore it is especially important that we build a system which can systematically collect cultural artifacts from all Asian cultures, introduce these relics to the public, and raise professional researchers specializing in these particular regions.If we maintained our present reckless course, collecting relics and promoting exchange with a short-sighted and careless manner, conducting shallow research, and neglecting the importance of raising experts, we have little hope in gaining a solid result from our exhibitions and cultural exchange with the Asian countries. It would be even more difficult to build any reliable museums specializing in Asian culture, such as museum of Asian anthropology.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Cameron, M.F.; Bengtson, J.L.; Boveng, P.L.; Jansen, J.K.; Kelly, B.P.; Dahle, S.P.; Logerwell, E.A.; Overland, J.E.; Sabine, C.L.; Waring, G.T.; Wilder, J.M.",Status Review of the Bearded Seal (Erignathus barbatus).,NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-AFSC,211,,i,"xvi, 1-246",,Dec-10,2010,"On March 28, 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) initiated a status review of the bearded seal under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) (73 FR 16617). Then on May 28, 2008, we received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity to list the bearded seal as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA, primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. To assist with determining whether listing of the bearded seal under the ESA is warranted, a Biological Review Team (BRT) was convened by the NMFS to assess the best available information concerning the status of ringed seals (Erignathus barbatus) and past, present, and future threats to the species. The BRT's review included delineating population structure within the species and assessing the risk of extinction at present and in the foreseeable future. The review is intended to inform NMFS's decision about whether to list the species as endangered or threatened. The ESA defines an endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The foreseeable future was not considered to be fixed but, rather, threat specific. Ice habitats are affected by climate which is forecast to continue changing directionally at least until the end of the century in response to greenhouse gas forcing. Variability in the magnitude[long dash]but not the directionality[long dash]of projected climate change increases over time and is reflected in inter-model variability and in levels of certainty assigned to the BRT's assessments of threats and demographic risks. Species Background: The bearded seal is a member of the true seals (Phocidae), a group of mammals highly adapted for a primarily aquatic existence. The species diverged about 11 million years ago from its nearest common ancestor with other extant seal species, prior to the emergence of the white fetal or natal coat that is typical of most northern phocid species and thought to be a specific adaptation to reproducing on sea ice. Nevertheless, they inhabit the seasonally ice-covered seas of the Northern Hemisphere where they whelp and rear their pups, and molt their coats on the ice in the spring and early summer. After reaching sexual maturity[long dash] typically at 5-6 years[long dash]most female bearded seals produce a single pup each year. Most pups are born in April, but March and May births are common in some areas. The pups are able to enter the water within hours of birth. They begin to forage while still under maternal care during a nursing period of about 24 days. Males typically attain sexual maturity at 6-7 years. A lifespan of about 20-25 years is normal, with a maximum of about 30 years. Like all phocids, bearded seals shed and regenerate their hair and epidermis annually but the process is more prolonged and diffuse than in other species. The timing and duration of molting seems to vary substantially among regions and individuals, but molting generally occurs in April to June or July. Bearded seals feed primarily on benthic organisms, including epifaunal and infaunal invertebrates, and demersal fishes and so are closely linked to areas where the seafloor is shallow. However, they are also able to switch their diet to include schooling pelagic fishes, when advantageous. Species Delineation: Two subspecies of bearded seals are widely recognized: E. b. barbatus often described as inhabiting the Atlantic sector, and E. b. nauticus inhabiting the Pacific sector. The geographic distributions of these subspecies are not separated by conspicuous gaps, and there are regions of intergrading generally described as somewhere along the northern Russian and central Canadian coasts. The BRT defined longitude 112[degree] W in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as the North American delineation between the two subspecies and 145[degree] E as the Eurasian delineation between the two subspecies. Based on evidence for discreteness and ecological uniqueness of bearded seals in the Sea of Okhotsk, the E. b. nauticus subspecies was further divided into an Okhotsk DPS and a Beringia DPS, so named because the continental shelf waters of the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian Seas that are the bearded seals range in this region overlie much of the land bridge that was exposed during the last glaciation and that has been referred to as Beringia. Extinction Risk Assessment: The BRT evaluated 19 specific threats to bearded seals grouped by the ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors: [center dot] the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range,[center dot] overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes,[center dot] disease or predation,[center dot] the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or [center dot] other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species' habitat or range: The BRT assessed the observed and projected changes with significant potential to impact the bearded seal's range and habitat, including both the physical and biological components of habitat, such as changes in sea ice, ocean temperature, ocean pH (acidity), and associated changes in bearded seal prey species. The main concern about the conservation status of bearded seals stems from the likelihood that their sea-ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A second major concern, related by the common driver of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is the modification of habitat by ocean acidification, which may alter prey populations and other important aspects of the marine ecosystem. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of each bearded seal species segment requires a focus on projections of specific regional conditions, especially sea ice. Global climate models selected for their consistency with the observed records of regional sea ice were used to project mean, minimum and maximum ice extent in each of the months of March, April, May, June, and July, for each of the decadal periods centered on the years 2030, 2050, and 2090. In a few regions, where the global climate models were poor at hindcasting the observed sea ice, less direct means of predicting ice cover[long dash]such as comparison of air temperature predictions with past climatology[long dash]were necessary. For bearded seals, the presence of sea ice is considered a requirement for whelping and nursing young. Similarly, the molt is believed to be promoted by elevated skin temperatures that, in polar regions, can only be achieved when seals haul out of the water. Thus, if suitable ice cover is absent from shallow feeding areas during times of peak whelping and nursing (April/May), or molting (May/June and sometimes through August), bearded seals would be forced to seek either sea-ice habitat over deeper waters (perhaps with poor access to food) or coastal regions in the vicinity of haul-out sites on shore (perhaps with increased risks of disturbance, predation, and competition). Both scenarios would require bearded seals to adapt to novel (i.e., suboptimal) conditions, and to exploit habitats to which they may not be well adapted, likely compromising their reproduction and survival rates. Research suggests that, during the time of whelping and nursing, bearded seals prefer areas where the percent concentration of sea ice is >25%. Lacking a more direct measure of the relationship between bearded seal vital rates and ice coverage, the BRT assumed that this preference relationship reflects the species requirements for sea-ice coverage and defined areas within the current core distribution of bearded seals where the ice projections were below 25% concentration, as inadequate for whelping and nursing. The BRT also assumed that ice coverage <15% would be insufficient for molting. In the Chukchi, Beaufort, East Siberian, Kara, Laptev, and Greenland Seas, as well as Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, little or no decline in ice extent is expected for the months of March [long dash] May during the remainder of the century; in most of these areas there will be a moderate decline of June ice cover and a substantial decline of July ice cover. More southerly waters, such as the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, and Barents Sea, are expected to have substantial reductions in average and minimum March - May ice extents by the middle or end of this century; June and July ice cover in these areas has historically been sparse and variable in June [long dash] July and will be even more so in the future. Although the distribution of bearded seal breeding and molting areas are not well documented, these more southerly parts of their range are likely to very important. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact bearded seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Changes in bearded seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Because of bearded seals' apparent dietary flexibility, this threat may be of less immediate concern than the threats from sea-ice degradation. Overutilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of bearded seals is currently at low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future for any of the DPSs. Bearded seals' solitary nature has made them less suitable for commercial exploitation than many other seal species. Still, they may have been depleted by commercial harvests in some areas of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering, Barents, and White Seas during the mid-20th century. There is currently no significant commercial harvest of bearded seals and significant harvests seem unlikely in the foreseeable future. Bearded seals have been a very important species for subsistence of indigenous people in the Arctic for thousands of years. The current subsistence harvest is substantial in some areas but there is little or no evidence that subsistence harvests have or are likely to pose serious risk to the species. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of diseases and parasites have been documented to occur in bearded seals. The seals have likely co-evolved with many of these and the observed prevalence is typical and similar to other species of seals. Abiotic and biotic changes to bearded seal habitat potentially could lead to exposure to new pathogens or new levels of virulence, but the BRT considered the potential threats to bearded seals as low. Polar bears are the primary predators of bearded seals, but other predators include brown bears, killer whales, sharks, and walruses. Predation under the future scenario of reduced sea ice is difficult to assess; polar bear predation may decrease, but predation by killer whales, sharks and walrus may increase. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: Harvests and incidental takes by fisheries and commercial activities are reasonably well regulated throughout the range of bearded seals. Currently, however, there are no effective mechanisms to regulate the global greenhouse gas emissions that are driving[long dash]via climate warming[long dash]destruction of ringed seal habitat. The BRT implicitly considered impacts of inadequate regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by way of the emissions scenarios used in forecast models; the scenarios were all non mitigated, meaning that they assumed no globally- significant framework for regulating or reducing emissions would be implemented. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Contaminants, oil and gas industry activities, fisheries, and shipping all have potential to impact bearded seal populations. Compared to the far-reaching changes expected in sea ice and ocean conditions, the future changes and impacts from these other factors were judged by the BRT as likely to be more localized and less significant. Status of the bearded seal species segments: The BRT reviewed published data and consulted with other experts to evaluate the specific threats to population persistence for the E. b. barbatus subspecies and the Beringia and Okhotsk DPSs of bearded seals. Threats were scored quantitatively and the level of certainty in scores was recorded. Risks posed by the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms were not included as part of this scoring. The BRT also assessed the risks to population persistence posed by those threats in demographic terms (abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity). E. b. barbatus: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 188,000 individuals. Sea ice of sufficient concentration is expected to persist in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Baffin Bay through the end of the century. Throughout the rest of E. b. barbatus's range, however, the reduction in sea ice is expected to be more dramatic, particularly in the Barents Sea which will become ice free in June within the next few decades. The impacts of the loss of sea ice in the Barents Sea, and the reduction of sea ice in the Kara Sea, could theoretically be offset by the creation of more suitable sea ice habitat in the Laptev Sea which currently has high concentrations of ice and low numbers of bearded seals, though we are not aware of past examples in which similar mitigative shifts in habitat have occurred during rapid climatic changes. The BRT judged the decoupling, or spatial separation of sea ice from benthic feeding habitat to be a moderate to high threat to the subspecies E. b. barbatus; this, and a decrease in sea-ice habitat suitable for molting were judged to be nearly the same strength and the most significant threats to the subspecies. Both threats stem from the anticipated reduction in sea ice area and seasonal persistence, and these combined with other sea-ice, climate, and ocean acidification threats were reflected in a moderate to high score overall for threats associated with habitat modification or loss. Threats within the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were judged to be low or moderate. The present risks that this subspecies is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low or very low in severity, reflecting the evidence that the population is large and apparently occupying its historic range. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the population in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (medium in severity), reflecting the anticipated decline in sea ice habitat over the remainder of the 21st century and consequent impacts on spatial structure (loss of habitat patches) and productivity (changes in vital rates of reproduction and survival). Beringia DPS: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 155,000 individuals. In the East Siberian, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas the average ice extents during the whelping, nursing, mating and part of the molting period are all predicted to be very close to historical averages out to 2095 with typically 25% or greater ice concentration over the entire shelf zones. End of century projections for the Bering Sea in April-May suggest that there will be sufficient ice only in small zones of the Gulf of Anadyr and in the area between St. Lawrence Island and Bering Strait. In June, suitable ice is predicted to disappear as early as mid-century. To adapt to this regime, bearded seals would likely have to shift their nursing, rearing and molting areas to the ice covered seas north of the Bering Strait. The most significant threats to the persistence of bearded seals in the Beringia DPS were judged to be the same ones as for the E. b. barbatus subspecies, plus the threat of a decrease in prey density or availability due to changes in ocean temperature and ice cover. These and other threats related to loss of sea ice habitat and climate-related changes in ocean conditions were scored in the moderate to high range, leading to an overall score of high for threats of habitat modification or loss. Threats within the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were judged to be low or moderate. The threat-specific and overall habitat factor scores were generally higher for the Beringia DPS than for E. b. barbatus, likely a measure of greater concern about declines in ice extent that would separate sea ice suitable for pup maturation and molting from benthic feeding areas. The risk of this is likely greater in the range of the Beringia DPS, where the spring and summer ice edge may retreat to deep water of the Arctic Ocean basin, than in much of the range of E. b. barbatus, where summer ice refugia are anticipated to occur in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland. The present risks that the Beringia DPS is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low or very low in severity, again on the basis of a large population occupying its historic range. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the population in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (medium to high in severity), and higher than the corresponding risks to E. b. barbatus. Okhotsk DPS: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 95,000 individuals. By the end of this century, the Sea of Okhotsk is predicted to frequently be ice free, or nearly so, during April [long dash] June, the crucial months for those important life history events. The ice-covered area is much smaller in the Sea of Okhotsk than the Bering Sea and, unlike in the Bering Sea, there is no marine connection to the Arctic Ocean. Over the long-term, bearded seals in the Sea of Okhotsk do not have the prospect of following a shift in the average position of the ice front northward as seals in the Bering Sea would. The greatest threats to the persistence of bearded seals in the Okhotsk DPS were judged to be decreases in sea ice habitat suitable for whelping, nursing, pup maturation, and molting. These threats, which were scored as high, are more severe in the range of the Okhotsk DPS than in the ranges of the Beringia DPS and E. b. barbatus. The overall score for habitat-related threats also was greatest for the Okhotsk DPS (high, tending toward very high). Although the scores for the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were in the low to moderate range, they tended to be higher than those for E. b. barbatus and the Beringia DPS. The present risks that the Okhotsk DPS is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low in severity but the numerical scores were somewhat higher than for the other species segments. This may be a result not only of stronger threats identified above, but also of the somewhat lower confidence (certainty scores) ascribed to the threats scores for the Okhotsk DPS. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the Okhotsk DPS in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (high for abundance, productivity, and spatial structure; medium for severity), and the highest of the three species segments.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Boveng, P.L.; Bengtson, J.L.; Buckley, T.W.; Cameron, M.F.; Dahle, S.P.; Megrey, B.A.; Overland, J.E.; Williamson, N.J.",Status review of the ribbon seal (Histriophoca fasciata).,NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-AFSC,191,,i,"xiv, 1-115",,Dec-08,2008,"This status review is intended to be a compilation of the best available information concerning the status of ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), including the past, present, and future threats to this species. It was compiled by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Biological Review Team (BRT) in response to a petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity to list the ribbon seal as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) (ESA), primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. There are two key tasks associated with conducting an ESA status review: The first is to delineate thetaxonomic group under consideration; the second is to conduct an extinction risk assessment to determine whether the petitioned species is threatened or endangered. The ESA defines the term endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The horizon of the foreseeable future was determined to be the year 2050 because past and current emissions of greenhouse gases have already largely set the course for changes in the atmosphere and climate until that time, and because of enormous uncertainty about future social and political decisions on emissions that will dominate projection of conditions further into the future. Species Background: The ribbon seal is a strikingly-marked member of the family Phocidae that primarily inhabits the Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering and Chukchi Seas. This species is strongly associated with the sea ice during its whelping, mating, and pelage molt periods, from mid-March through June. Most of the rest of the year is spent at sea; the species is rarely observed on land. The rates of survival and reproduction are not well known, but ribbon seals can live 20 to 30 years. They become sexually mature at 1-5 years of age, probably depending on environmental conditions, and adult females usually give birth every year to a single pup which is nursed for 3-4 weeks and then abandoned to fend for itself. Species Delineation: Although there are two main breeding areas for ribbon seals, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and one in the Bering Sea, there is currently no evidence of discrete subpopulations on which to base a separation into distinct population segments. The population composing the entire species is the subject of this review. A molecular genetic analysis to identify geographic population structure is a high priority for research. Extinction Risk Assessment: To assess the extinction risk, the BRT evaluated the risks based on specificdemographic factors of the species, such as abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity, as well as specific threats faced by the species, as outlined in Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA: [center dot] the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, [center dot] over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, [center dot] disease or predation,. the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or [center dot] other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence Demographic factors: With a population likely comprising at least 200,000 individuals, ribbon seals are not currently at risk from the demographic issues of low abundance commonly associated with ESAlisting decisions, such as demographic stochasticity, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and depensatory effects. The current population trend is unknown, but a recent estimate of 49,000 ribbon seals in the eastern and central Bering Sea is consistent enough with historical estimates to suggest that no major or catastrophic change has occurred in recent decades. The species is thought to occupy its entire historically-observed range; there are no portions of the range in which ribbon seals have been reported to have disappeared or become extinct. A comprehensive survey of ribbon seal abundance, a new analysis of demographic data obtained from the former Soviet commercial harvest, and genetic studies of population structure are high priorities for research and monitoring. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species habitat or range: The main concerns about the conservation status of the ribbon seal stem from the likelihood that its sea ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of ribbon seals requires a focus on projections of the specific regional conditions, especially sea ice, and changes that could impact vital rates. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice is present year-round, the ice in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk is seasonal in nature. Despite the recent dramatic reductions in Arctic Ocean ice extent during summer, the sea ice in the northern Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk is expected to continue forming annually in winter for the foreseeable future. The sea ice regimes in these seas will continue to be subject to large interannual variations in extent and seasonal duration, as they have throughout recorded history. While there may be more frequent years in which ice coverage is reduced, the late March to early May period in which ribbon seal reproduction occurs will continue to have substantial ice, particularly in the northern regions of the breeding range. In years of low ice it is likely that ribbon seals will adjust at least in part by shifting their breeding locations in response to the position of the ice edge as they have likely done in the past in response to interannual variability. There could be impacts on ribbon seal survival and recruitment from more frequent years of reduced ice thickness and duration of seasonal ice coverage. Decreased availability of stable platforms for adults to complete their molt out of the water may lower survival, but it is not currently possible to quantify this impact or the extent to which ribbon seals may adapt by shifting locations for key life history events of breeding and molting. Weaned pups are likely dependent on sea ice for a 2-3 week period as they develop self-sufficiency in foraging. They enter the water regularly during this period, and therefore may not be particularly sensitive to modest reductions in coverage or quality, though they may be relatively limited in their capability to respond to rapidly deteriorating ice fields by relocating over large distances, a factor that could occur more frequently in the foreseeable future. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact ribbon seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Because of ribbon seals apparent dietary flexibility and because the major effects of ocean acidification may not appear until the latter half of this century, this threat should be of less immediate concern than the direct effects of sea ice degradation. Changes in ribbon seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Some changes already documented in the Bering Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean are of a nature that could be ameliorative or beneficial to ribbon seals. For example, several fish species, including walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), a common ribbon seal prey, have shown northward distribution shifts and increased recruitment in response to warming, at least initially. These ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Apparent flexibility in ribbon seal foraging locations and habits may make these threats of lower concern than more direct impacts from changes in sea ice. The threats associated with impacts of global warming on ribbon seal habitat, to the extent that they may pose risks to ribbon seals, were presumed to manifest throughout the current breeding and molting range (for sea-ice related threats) or throughout the entire range (for ocean warming and acidification) of the species, in as much as the finer-scale spatial distribution of these threats is not currently well understood. The question, therefore, of whether any of these poses a risk to the continued existence of ribbon seals in merely a significant portion of, rather than the entire, range was subsumed by this approach to the qualitative risk assessment. Over-utilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of ribbon seals is currently at very low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future. Commercial harvests by Russian sealers have at times been high enough to cause significant reductions in abundance and catchper-unit-effort. The population apparently rebounded from a period of high harvest in the 1960s. Substantial but lower numbers were harvested for a few years in the early 1990s. Although Russian government quotas were recently in place that would allow large harvests (~18,000 annually), the actual takes are low because of poor economic viability. There is some effort in Russia to develop new uses and markets for seal products, but unless these are successful, the harvest is unlikely to increase in the near future. Subsistence harvest levels have been low historically, but could potentially increase in the future if ribbon seals are forced to use a reduced and more northerly ice field, which could put them in closer proximity to Alaska Native communities near the Bering Strait. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of pathogens (or antibodies), diseases, helminthes, cestodes, and nematodes, have been found in ribbon seals. The prevalence of these agents is not unusual among seals, but the population impact is unknown. There may be an increased risk of outbreaks of novel pathogens or parasites as climate-related shifts in species distributions lead to new modes of transmission. There is little or no direct evidence of significant predation on ribbon seals and they are not thought to be a primary prey of any predators. Polar bears and killer whales may be the most likely opportunistic predators in the current sea ice regime, but walruses could pose a potentially greater risk if reduced sea ice conditions force these pagophilic species into closer proximity in the future. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: There is little evidence that the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms currently poses a threat to ribbon seals. However, there are no known regulatory mechanisms that effectively address reductions in sea ice habitat at this time. Also, it is unclear what regulatory mechanisms are in place to ensure that potential commercial harvests in Russia are conducted in a sustainable fashion. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Although some pollutants are elevated in ribbon seals, there is no conspicuous evidence of toxicity or other significant impacts to the species. Continued and expanded monitoring would be prudent, to document any trends in the contaminants of greatest concern. Oil and gas exploration and development activities may include artificial- island construction, drilling operations, pipeline construction, seismic surveys, and vessel and aircraft operations. The main issues for evaluating the impacts of exploration and development activities on ribbon seals are the effects of noise, disturbance, and potential oil spills produced from these activities. Any negative effects on ribbon seals from noise and disturbance associated with development activities are likely to be minor and localized. Ribbon seals are also highly dispersed during the summer, open-water season so the rate ofinteractions with seismic surveys would likely be low, and in any case seals have not been shown to be significantly impacted by oil and gas seismic surveys. The threat posed to ribbon seals by oil spills will increase if offshore oil and gas development and shipping activities increase across their range as predicted. The potential impacts would be greatest during April-June when the seals are relatively aggregated, and substantially lower during the remainder of the year when they are dispersed in the open water throughout the North Pacific Ocean, Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering and Chukchi Seas. Estimates from observed by-catch in commercial fisheries imply that less than 200 ribbon seals per year are taken, though mortalities are certainly under-reported in some fisheries. Because there is little or no fishery activity near aggregations of ribbon seals when they are associated with ice, and they are highly dispersed in the remainder of the year, by-catch is unlikely to be a significant threat to ribbon seal populations. For the same reason, competition from fisheries that reduce local abundance of ribbon seal prey is unlikely to be significant. Broad-scale reduction in a commercially-fished, primary prey species could have a significant impact, but the large groundfish fisheries in Alaska waters, at least, are well managed to prevent depletion of the stocks. The extraordinary reduction in Arctic sea ice that has occurred in recent years has renewed interest in trans-Arctic navigation routes connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route. The Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait would be the most likely areas for increased exposure of pelagic ribbon seals to ship traffic, because of the geographic constriction and the seasonal migration of part of the ribbon seal population around the beginning and end of the ice-free season. However, there is currently little or no information on direct impacts from shipping on seals in open water. Ribbon seals hauled out on sea ice may also be at risk from increased ship traffic, but likely only during spring and early summer, and then only by ice-reinforced ships. Assessing risk from increases in shipping and transportation is difficult because projections about future ship trends within the ribbon seal's range are currently unavailable.Several of the threats considered in this section on Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence were associated with specific regions or times of year when ribbon seal distribution is restricted, such as increased ship traffic in the Bering Strait region or oil and gas activities during the ribbon seal breeding and molting seasons. If such threats were to occur and cause a high rate of mortality or forgone reproduction, the species could be considered threatened or endangered in a significant portion of its range. However, none of the threats considered here is presently considered to be both sufficiently likely to occur and sufficiently high in impact, alone or cumulatively, to raise concernabout them posing a risk of ribbon seal extinction or becoming endangered throughout a significant portion of its range. Status of the ribbon seal population: Qualitative assessments of the balance between identified threats and a species' capability to adjust must often be decided on the basis of expert opinion and on policy, especially policy regarding consideration given to uncertainty. Such policy is outside the scope of this status review. To assist in the process, however, the BRT addressed its summary conclusions on ribbon seal status using a scoring system in which each of the eight members assigned up to 10 likelihood points in support of the conclusion. In consideration of all of the threats and potential threats identified above, the assessment of the risks posed by those threats, the possible cumulative impacts, and the uncertainty associated with all of these, the BRT drew the following conclusions: 1. Ribbon seals are not in current danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. (78 out of 80 likelihood points) 2. The ribbon seal population is likely to decline gradually for the foreseeable future, primarily from slight but chronic impacts on reproduction and survival caused by reduced frequency of years with sea ice of suitable extent, quality, and duration of persistence. (51 out of 80 likelihood points) 3. Despite the expectation of a gradual decline, ribbon seals are not likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range. (57 out of 80 likelihood points) Finally, to reinforce the notion that reliable and effective assessments of species of conservation status cannot be conducted without adequate estimates of abundance, the BRT concluded that despite the expectation of a declining ribbon seal population, it will likely not be possible to detect and document a significant overall decline unless monitoring is made a very high priority for both the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Boveng, P.L.; Bengtson, J.L.; Buckley, T.W.; Cameron, M.F.; Dahle, S.P.; Kelly, B.P.; Megrey, B.A.; Overland, J.E.; Williamson, N.J.",Status review of the spotted seal (Phoca largha).,NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-AFSC,200,,i,"xiii, 1-153",,Oct-09,2009,"This status review is intended to be a compilation of the best available information concerning the status of spotted seals (Phoca largha), including the past, present, and future threats to this species. It was compiled by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Biological Review Team (BRT) in response to a petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity to list the spotted seal as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. There are two key tasks associated with conducting an ESA status review: The first is to delineate the taxonomic group under consideration; the second is to conduct an extinction risk assessment for support of a determination of whether the species is threatened or endangered. The ESA defines the term endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The BRT considered the time frames over which threats to spotted seals [long dash] and their response to those threats [long dash] are foreseeable, and concluded that there is no scientific basis for a single time frame that defines the foreseeable future. The threats of primary concern, stemming from rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and the associated warming climate, have been projected from climate models for the 21st century and were thus evaluated over that time frame. The scientific literature as well as recent, yet-to-be published research results were reviewed and summarized to support the extinction risk assessment of this rather poorly understood species. Species Background: The spotted seal is a member of the pinniped family Phocidae that is similar in appearance to its close relative, the widely-distributed harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Spotted seals breed in the Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering Sea. This species is primarily associated with sea ice during its whelping, nursing, mating, and pelage molt periods, though in some places these functions take place on shore. These functions occur earliest (January-April) in the Yellow Sea, and latest (April-June) in the Bering Sea. Most spotted seals spend the rest of the year making periodic foraging trips from haul-out sites ashore or on sea ice. The vital rates of survival and reproduction are not well known. Both sexes usually reach maturity at about 4-5 years of age, and most mature females give birth to a single pup annually. Spotted seals may live to 30-35 years of age. They consume a broad variety of mostly fishes and some crustaceans and cephalopods, taken from waters over the continental shelves and shelf breaks. Species Delineation: Eight main areas of spotted seal breeding have been reported. On the basis of small samples and preliminary analyses of genetic composition, potential geographic barriers, and significance of breeding groups, the species was divided into three Distinct Population Segments (DPSs): The Bering DPS; the Okhotsk DPS; and the Southern DPS, which is composed of the spotted seals breeding in the Yellow Sea and Peter the Great Bay in the Sea of Japan. These were considered separately whenever there was sufficient information to assess the risks specific to each DPS. Extinction Risk Assessment: To assess the extinction risk, the BRT evaluated the specific threats faced by the species, as outlined in Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA: * the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, * overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, * disease or predation, * the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or * other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence The risks posed by these threats were then assessed in terms of their implications for demographic factors, such as abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species' habitat or range: The main concern about the conservation status of spotted seals stems from the likelihood that their sea-ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A second major concern, related by the common driver of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is the modification of habitat by ocean acidification, which may alter prey populations and other important aspects of the marine ecosystem. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of each spotted seal DPS requires a focus on projections of specific regional conditions, especially sea ice. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice is present year-round, the ice in the sub-Arctic seas of the spotted seal breeding range is seasonal in nature. Despite the recent dramatic reductions in Arctic Ocean ice extent during summer, the sea ice in the Bering Sea is expected to continue forming annually in winter for the foreseeable future, based on consensus (but still highly uncertain) projections through the 21st century. The sea-ice regime will continue to be subject to large interannual variations in extent and seasonal duration, as it has throughout recorded history. There will likely be more frequent years in which ice coverage is reduced, resulting in a decline in the long-term average ice extent, but Bering Sea spotted seals will likely continue to encounter sufficient ice to support adequate vital rates. Even if sea ice were to vanish completely from the Bering Sea, there may be prospects for spotted seals to adjust their breeding grounds to follow the northward shift of the annual ice front into the Chukchi Sea. For the Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and Yellow Sea, current global climate models for sea ice do not perform satisfactorily. Inference about future ice conditions in these areas was drawn indirectly from projections of air or sea surface temperatures, and thus has even greater uncertainty than the projections for the Bering Sea. All three regions are likely to experience sufficient warming by the latter half of the 21st century that ice conditions will be significantly compromised in extent or duration during the important months for spotted seal pup suckling and pup maturation. In the Southern DPS, this may already occur on a regular basis, as much of the breeding now takes place ashore on rocks and small islands. There is no prospect in the Okhotsk or Southern DPS for long-term shifts of the breeding range into the Arctic Ocean because these areas have no northern marine connectivity to the Arctic. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact spotted seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Because of spotted seals' apparent dietary flexibility, this threat should be of less immediate concern than the direct effects of sea-ice degradation. Changes in spotted seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Some changes already documented in the Bering Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean are of a nature that could be ameliorative or beneficial to spotted seals. For example, several fish species, including walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), a common spotted seal prey, have shown northward distribution shifts and increased recruitment in response to warming, at least initially. These ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Apparent flexibility in spotted seal foraging locations and habits may make these threats of lower concern than more direct impacts from changes in sea ice. Overutilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of spotted seals is currently at low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future for any of the DPSs. Commercial harvests by Soviet sealers were at moderate levels from the mid-1950s to the early 1990s. Russia has established harvest quotas in recent years but no significant numbers have been taken because of poor economic viability of the hunt. Subsistence harvest levels have been moderate historically in both the Bering and Okhotsk DPS but are not anticipated to increase significantly. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of pathogens (or antibodies), diseases, helminthes, cestodes, and nematodes, have been found in spotted seals. The prevalence of these agents is not unusual among seals, but the population impact is unknown. There may be an increased risk of outbreaks of novel pathogens or parasites as climate-related shifts in species distributions lead to new modes of transmission. There is little or no direct evidence of significant predation on spotted seals and they are not thought to be a primary prey of any predators. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) may be the most likely opportunistic predators in the current sea-ice regime, but walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) could pose a potentially greater risk if reduced sea-ice conditions force these pagophilic species into closer proximity in the future. Also predation risk could increase if loss of sea ice requires spotted seals to spend more time in the water or more time ashore. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: There are currently no effective mechanisms to regulate GHG emissions domestically or internationally. The BRT did not attempt to separate the risk posed by the lack of a regulatory mechanism for GHG emissions from the risks posed by the effects of the emissions. The risks posed by future GHG emissions, via potential destruction or modification of spotted seal habitat, were assessed as described above by evaluating the best available projections of future conditions under scenarios of no regulation of GHGs (the projections were based on non- mitigated scenarios for future emissions). Therefore, the implications of the current lack of regulations are already included in the evaluation of risks to spotted seal habitat in the three DPSs. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms poses no additional threat to any of the spotted seal DPSs. In other words, while there are no regulatory mechanisms that effectively address reductions in sea ice habitat or ocean acidification, we do not expect this shortcoming to result in population-level impacts beyond those already identified in the section on present or threatened destruction of habitat. Inadequacy or lack of stringency of mechanisms to regulate oil and gas activities in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Okhotsk could contribute to the cumulative risk faced by the Southern and Okhotsk DPSs. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Risks could be significant to the Southern and Okhotsk DPSs from petroleum exploration, development, and production activities because these activities are already underway in those areas. Potentially significant interactions with commercial fisheries may pose significant risks, as well. Conclusions: Bering DPS: The primary threats faced by spotted seals in the Bering Sea are likely to be climate-related changes to the sea-ice habitat and to the prey community. Sea ice is expected to decline such that the average extent in May, during the latter half of the period for nursing and initial independent development of pups, is limited to areas north of St. Lawrence Island by about the middle of the 21st century. There will, however, likely continue to be large interannual variations of nearly the same magnitude as in the past, so that some years will have very extensive ice and others will have very low ice extent. The low ice years, which will come more frequently than in the past, may have impacts on recruitment, primarily through pup survival. On the other hand, some aspects of reduced ice may be beneficial to spotted seals, mitigating the impacts of low ice years. This is possible because of the prospect that thinner and more broken ice is likely to occur over large areas of the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea that are currently too densely covered to be suitable for spotted seal breeding. The impacts of ocean acidification, the other significant climate-related threat to spotted seals, are even less predictable than the impacts of sea-ice reduction. Spotted seals, like other ice-associated species, are adapted for coping with large ranges of variability in conditions. There is currently no quantitative basis for determining whether the climate-related habitat impacts will outweigh the mitigating factors. No other threats were thought to pose significant demographic risks to the Bering DPS. A large population (at least 100,000) has persisted over the past several decades with no conspicuous extreme fluctuations. The suite of risks from overutilization, disease and predation, inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms, and other natural or human factors is not anticipated to change sufficiently to place the Bering DPS at risk of extinction within the foreseeable future. Okhotsk DPS: The threats faced by spotted seals in the Sea of Okhotsk are the same as to those in the Bering Sea, but the projections of future climate-related habitat conditions are less certain. In consideration of observed climatology and projected air temperatures, much of the region may have ice-deteriorating conditions in April by the mid-21st century. This region is characterized by some differences from the Bering Sea that may be significant to the status of spotted seals. The ice-covered area is smaller in the Sea of Okhotsk and there is no marine connection to the Arctic Ocean, unlike in the Bering Sea. Over the very long term, spotted seals in the Sea of Okhotsk do not have the prospect of following a retreating ice front northward into the Arctic, as Bering Sea spotted seals would. There is xiii currently no basis to judge whether ocean acidification will be any more severe or rapid in the Sea of Okhotsk than in other parts of the North Pacific, so the impact from that threat is no more predictable than for the other spotted seal DPSs. Although most of the other risks are expected to be similarly low between the Bering and Okhotsk DPSs, the risks associated with petroleum exploration, development, and production are likely to be significantly greater in the Okhotsk DPS. Oil production and further development in the Sea of Okhotsk are well underway and likely to be less stringently regulated than similar activities that are as yet only proposed for the Bering and Chukchi Seas (at least in U.S. waters). Commercial fishery interactions, either direct or indirect, also may pose a significant risk in the Okhotsk DPS. Together, these risks and the climate-related risks summarized above could have substantial cumulative effects. The demographic status of the Okhotsk DPS is less certain than the Bering DPS, but large numbers (as high as 268,000) of spotted seals were reported in the late-1960s to 1990. No conspicuous extreme changes are known to have occurred more recently. Even if the population was typically overestimated by a factor of 2, there would likely be approximately 100,000 spotted seals currently in the Okhotsk DPS, so that demographic and genetic risks from low abundance should not be a significant concern. Southern DPS: Although there is great uncertainty in projecting sea-ice conditions for the Yellow Sea andSea of Japan, sea-ice formation in the recent past has already been greatly reduced, and indirect evidence from air and sea surface temperature modeling suggests that seasonal ice will rarely form in these areas by about the middle of the 21st century. The species appears to have some capability to accomplish breeding and molting on shore when ice is not available. However, pinnipeds are generally not well protected from predation when they are constrained by the necessity of maintaining a mother- pup bond; that is, when escape to the water may disrupt the bond or poses thermoregulation problems for the pup. Therefore, suitable space for spotted seals to breed on land is likely limited to offshore rocks and small islands without human habitation, which are relatively scarce in the Southern DPS. The dire status of spotted seals in the Southern DPS is likely to be maintained or worsened by the cumulative effects of: poaching for genitalia and culling by fisherman; loss of sea-ice habitat; breeding and molting in a non-preferred and possibly scarce habitat (ashore vs. on ice); reduced prey populations (e.g., pollock in the Sea of Japan and herring in the Yellow Sea); possible prey community disruption from ocean warming and acidification; and oil and gas development activities. The population sizes are already significantly reduced from historical levels, and if reduced further they may begin to be at significant risk from small-population threats such as demographic stochasticity and genetic problems. The small sizes of these populations, as well ecologically unique characteristics associated with life at the southern extremity of the species' range, have been recognized by China, South Korea, and Russia through designation of special conservation status on the seals and portions of their habitat, though the effectiveness of these measures for preventing extinction is uncertain.",,,,,,,,,,,J,"Wang, Lijing; Wang, Bangguo; Cen, Wenxi; Xu, Rui; Huang, Yuwei; Zhang, Xin; Han, Yinghui; Zhang, Yuanxun",Ecological impacts of the expansion of offshore wind farms on trophic level species of marine food chain.,Journal of environmental sciences (China),139,,226,244,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.002,2024-May,2024,"The global demand for renewable energy has resulted in a rapid expansion of offshore wind farms (OWFs) and increased attention to the ecological impacts of OWFs on the marine ecosystem.

This will allow the formulation and testing of specific hypotheses built on ecological theory, thereby streamlining the process, and allowing adaptability in the face of technological advancements (e.g. floating offshore wind) and shifting socio-economic and political climates. We outline a strategy by which to accelerate our understanding of environmental effects of OWF development on shelf seas, which is illustrated throughout by a North Sea case study. Priorities for future studies include ascertaining the extent to which OWFs may change levels of primary production; whether wind energy extraction will have knock-on effects on biophysical ecosystem drivers; whether pelagic fishes mediate changes in top predator distributions over space and time; and how any effects observed at localized levels will scale and interact with climate change and fisheries displacement effects.",No,Ray,,,,,,,,,J,"Dong, Shuang-Lin; Dong, Yun-Wei; Huang, Liu-Yi; Zhou, Yan-Gen; Cao, Ling; Tian, Xiang-Li; Han, Li-Min; Li, Da-Hai",Advancements and hurdles of deeper-offshore aquaculture in China,REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE,,,,,10.1111/raq.12858,,2023,"Open offshore areas boast strong physical self-purification capacity and abundant non-fossil energy resources, such as wind, waves, and solar energy.

Although DOA holds vast potential to address food security and aquaculture sustainability in China, its current development trajectory struggles to meet those goals and primarily achieves profitability by focusing on high-value species or products. For DOA to realize its potential, innovative production systems must tackle three key contradictions: enterprise profitability versus product affordability, clean energy-based products versus carbon-intensive products, and automated operation versus re-employment of coastal fish farmers. Resolving these contradictions requires the development of a large-scale, anti-typhoon offshore enclosure that integrates mariculture with other industries, such as wind farming, food processing, and tourism.

This study examines the potential for renewable energy integration with RASs to improve their financial and environmental feasibility, while also presenting an overview of its potential and challenges for system optimisation modelling, which is presently absent in the existing literature.

To address the challenges of intermittency and instability that arise in the development of renewable energy for RAS, more research on economic and energy optimisation is needed to meet the requirements of design, planning, scheduling, operation, and control of aquaculture. Systematic decision-making guidelines for greater energy efficiency in aquaculture based on system optimisation modelling can improve the sustainability of aquaculture and help to address UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).

Three ES were studied, food production from fishing, top predator production for cultural purposes and the potential resistance of the ecosystem inferred from its organization. The ability of the Seine Bay ecosystem to produce food appears to be negatively impacted by the effect of climate change. Because of the important economic role of fishing in Normandy, such changes could percolate on the entire social and economic system of the bay.

Additionally, hy-pothetical MPAs designated with specific ecological objectives in mind were tested. Scenario outcomes suggest that closures may need to be accompanied with additional fisheries management measures to avoid unintended negative impacts outside the closed areas. Furthermore, size and placement of spatial closures are important factors influencing overall benefits and losses in terms of ecological health and fisheries yield.

The problem can be overcome by developing eco-friendly ways for producing plastics-like biopolymers from waste residues such as of agricultural origin. This will solve two currently prevailing social issues: waste man-agement and the efficient production of a biopolymer that is environmentally benign, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). The current study assesses the environmental impact of biopolymer (PHA) manufacturing, starting from slaughterhouse waste as raw material. The Material Input Per Service Unit methodology (MIPS) is used to examine the sustainability of the PHA production process. In addition, the impact of shifting from business-as-usual energy provision (i.e., electricity from distribution grid network and heat provision from natural gas) to alternative renewable energy sources is also evaluated. As a major outcome, it is shown that the abiotic material contribution for PHA production process is almost double for using hard coal as an energy source than the petro-plastic low-density-poly(ethene) (LPDE), which PHA shall ultimately replace. Likewise, abiotic material contri-bution is 43 % and 7 % higher when using the electricity from the European electricity mix (EU-27 mix) and biogas, respectively, than in the case of LDPE production. However, PHA production based on wind power for energy provision has 12 % lower abiotic material input than LDPE. Furthermore, the water input decreases when moving from the EU-27 mix to wind power. The reduction in water consumption for various electricity provision resources amounts to 20 % for the EU-27 mix, 25 % for hard coal, 71 % for wind, and 70 % for biogas. As the main conclusion, it is demonstrated that using wind farm electricity to generate PHA is the most environmentally friendly choice.

The objectives are to efficiently manage an urban farm's food, energy, and water resources, decrease food waste, and increase the food availability for the local community. A case study of eleven farms was investigated in Vancouver, Canada to study the linkages between the resources in the urban food, energy, and water nexus. Each urban farm in the simulation belonged to a community microgrid generating electricity from solar and wind. The local farms aimed to provide fresh produce for their respective local communities. However, at some points, they lacked supply, and at other points, there was excess supply, leading to food waste. Food waste can be converted into fertilizers or bioenergy. However, an alternative solution must be employed due to the natural resources required for production, efficiently managing resources, and adhering to sustainability guidelines. In this paper, an optimization framework was integrated within the agent-based model to create a micro supply chain. The supply chain directly linked the producers with the consumers by severing the links involved in a traditional food supply. Each urban farm in the study collaborated to reduce food wastage and meet consumer demands, establishing farmer-to-farmer exchange in transitional agriculture. The optimization-based micro supply chain aimed to minimize costs and meet the equilibrium between food supply and demand. Regular communication between the farms reduced food waste by 96.9% over 16 weeks. As a result, the fresh food availability increased for the local community, as exemplified by the consumer purchases over the same period. Moreover, the simulation results indicated that the renewable energy generation at the community microgrids aided in the generation of 22,774 Mwh from solar and 2568 Mwh from wind.

We review 10 case studies that demonstrate the use of EwE to support operational resource management. EwE models are being used to inform tactical decision-making in fisheries and other ocean use sectors, as well as to identify key trade-offs, develop appropriate policy objectives, and reconcile conflicting legislative mandates in a variety of ecosystems. We suggest the following criteria to enhance the use of EwE and other ecosystem models in operational resource management: (1) a clear management objective that can be addressed through modelling; (2) an important trade-off and a receptive policy context amenable to trade-off evaluation; (3) an accessible and well-documented model that follows best practices; (4) early and iterative engagement among scientists, stakeholders, and managers; (5) integration within a collaborative management process; (6) a multi-model approach; and (7) a rigorous review process. Our review suggests that existing management frameworks are as much or more of a limitation to the operational use of EwE than technical issues related to data availability and model uncertainty.

Constructive engagement between new developers, coastal communities, and fisheries will become increasingly necessary in order to minimize conflict and increase production. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a technique used to make informed decisions about the sustainable use of marine resources. Offshore developers have begun to use MSP in order to achieve these goals of minimized conflicts, increased production, and greater sustainability. In this paper, an open-source MSP tool is developed to plan a favorable deployment location for a wave-powered aquaculture farm (WPAF) growing Atlantic salmon in the Northeast U.S. The MSP tool finds an optimal deployment location for the WPAF, while avoiding conflicts with existing or planned offshore activities, including recreational and commercial fisheries, military zones, offshore wind farms, shipping lanes, and marine protected areas. The planning objective is to find a deployment location where the total cost of weekly vessel travel to a WPAF and the cost of the wave energy converters (WECs) used to power the farm is minimized. In addition, this deployment location must meet the environmental needs of fish, have the required wave environment for sufficient wave energy production to supply the aquaculture farm, and avoid conflicts with the aforementioned industries. To solve this MSP optimization problem, we use a brute-force searching method through a coarse grid in the Northeast U.S. to find the optimal deployment location. The MSP tool is tested for multiple sizes of an Atlantic salmon offshore aquaculture farm: small (5 net pens), medium (12 net pens), and large (40 net pens), and the power needs of the farm are supplied by a twobody point-absorber WEC (the Department of Energy Reference Model 3). The optimal deployment location is found to be the same for all sized farms at 44.1 degrees N and 67.9 degrees W, about 35km off the Coast of Acadia National Park, since this location has the highest wave power density and hence minimizes the number of WECs needed to power each farm.",No,Ray,,,,,,,,,J,"Daewel, Ute; Akhtar, Naveed; Christiansen, Nils; Schrum, Corinna",Offshore wind farms are projected to impact primary production and bottom water deoxygenation in the North Sea,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,3,1,,,10.1038/s43247-022-00625-0,Nov 24 2022,2022,"Atmospheric wakes caused by offshore wind farms built in the North Sea may affect marine ecosystems, both at the surface ocean and at the seafloor, according to a numerical modeling study.The wind wake effect of offshore wind farms affects the hydrodynamical conditions in the ocean, which has been hypothesized to impact marine primary production.

The results show a significant reduction in the air-sea heat fluxes and a local, annual mean net cooling of the lower atmosphere in the wind farm areas down to more than 2.0 Wm(-2), due to a decrease in 10 m wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy and an increase in low-level clouds. Mean surface winds decreased by approximately 1 ms(-1) downstream of wind farms. Furthermore, an increase of approximately 5% in mean precipitation was found over the wind farm areas. At a seasonal timescale, these differences are higher during winter and autumn than in other seasons. Although the offshore wind farms reduce the heat transport from the ocean to the atmosphere in the region of large wind farms, the atmospheric layers below the hub height show an increase in temperature, which is on the order of up to 10% of the climate change signal at the end of the century, but it is much smaller than the interannual climate variability.

However, the nexus between drivers, such as changes in the bio-physical environment from the introduction of structures and extraction of energy, and the consequent impacts on ecosystem services delivery and natural capital assets is poorly understood and rarely considered through a whole ecosystem perspective. Future marine planning needs to assess these changes as part of national policy level assessments but also to inform practitioners about the benefits and trade-offs between different uses of natural resources when making decisions to balance environmental and energy sustainability and socio-economic impacts. To address this shortfall, we propose an ecosystem-based natural capital evaluation framework that builds on a dynamic Bayesian modelling approach which accounts for the multiplicity of interactions between physical (e.g. bottom temperature), biological (e.g. net primary production) indicators and anthropogenic marine use (i.e. fishing) and their changes across space and over time.

Such a framework has the potential of exploring the likely outcomes in the same metrics (both ecological and socio-economic) from alternative management and climate scenarios, such that objective judgements and decisions can be made, as to how to balance the benefits and trade-offs between a range of marine uses to deliver long-term environmental sustainability, economic benefits, and social welfare.",Yes,Ray,No,No,Ray,,,,Conceptual modeling,,J,"Martinez, A.; Iglesias, G.",Site selection of floating offshore wind through the levelised cost of energy: A case study in Ireland,ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,266,,,,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115802,Aug 15 2022,2022,"Potential areas for the development of a floating offshore wind farm by means of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) are studied through a case study in the Republic of Ireland.

Assessing the population-level impact of fisheries bycatch and other human-caused mortality of wildlife has typically relied upon deterministic methods. However, population declines are often accelerated by stochastic factors that are not accounted for in such conventional methods. Building on the widely applied potential biological removal (PBR) equation, we devised a new populationmodeling approach for estimating sustainable limits to human-caused mortality and applied it in a case study of bottlenose dolphins affected by capture in an Australian demersal otter trawl fishery. Our approach, termed sustainable anthropogenic mortality in stochastic environments (SAMSE), incorporates environmental and demographic stochasticity, including the dependency of offspring on theirmothers. The SAMSE limit is the maximum number of individuals that can be removed without causing negative stochastic population growth. We calculated a PBR of 16.2 dolphins per year based on the best abundance estimate available. In contrast, the SAMSE model indicated that only 2.3-8.0 dolphins could be removed annually without causing a population decline in a stochastic environment. These results suggest that reported bycatch rates are unsustainable in the long term, unless reproductive rates are consistently higher than average. The difference between the deterministic PBR calculation and the SAMSE limits showed that deterministic approaches may underestimate the true impact of human-caused mortality of wildlife.

Sector development has been led in Europe, but is growing globally. Most developments to date have been in well-mixed, i.e., unstratified, shallow-waters near to shore. Sector growth is, for the first time, pushing developments to deep water, into a brand new environment: seasonally stratified shelf seas. Seasonally stratified shelf seas, where water density varies with depth, have a disproportionately key role in primary production, marine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycling. Infrastructure will directly mix stratified shelf seas. The magnitude of this mixing, additional to natural background processes, has yet to be fully quantified. If large enough it may erode shelf sea stratification. Therefore, offshore wind growth may destabilize and fundamentally change shelf sea systems. However, enhanced mixing may also positively impact some marine ecosystems.

We developed a simple process-based model for estimating the effects of windbreak structure on maize yield in cool humid climates. In this model, both yield gain due to growth rate promotion resulting from increased soil temperature, and yield loss due to shading were considered. The model was validated with maize field measurements in Hokkaido, northern Japan. The average maize whole plant and grain yield for four years were 4% and 5% greater in the sheltered zone (3-5 H; H = windbreak height) and 22% and 30% lower in the competition zone (0.5-1 H), respectively, than 10-11 H.

Compared to an open field, the net benefit throughout the field was estimated to be 2-3% and 6-11% for whole plant and grain, respectively. The windbreak design that maximized the wind speed reduction did not necessarily maximize the windbreak benefit on maize yield. The proposed optimal total area density differed depending on the windbreak orientation, even under the same meteorological conditions. For windbreaks taller than 5-15 m, those oriented on the west and southwest sides had lower optimal total area density than windbreaks on the south side due to greater shading effects.

Assessing the long-term environmental impacts in terms of eutrophication and noise is a priority for both the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and cumulative impacts will be important for the Maritime Spatial Planning under the Integrated Maritime Policy. With the constant expansion of aquaculture production, it is expected that farms might be established further offshore in more remote areas, as high-energy conditions offer an opportunity to generate more power locally using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) devices. A proposed solution is the co-location of MRE devices and aquaculture systems using Multi-Purpose Platforms (MPPs) comprising offshore wind turbines (OWTs) that will provide energy for farm operations as well as potentially shelter the farm.

Here we created a high-resolution spatiotemporal Ecospace model of the West of Scotland, in order to assess impacts of a simple MPP configuration on the surrounding ecosystem and how these impacts can cascade through the food web.

Weak responses of the food-web were found for top-down changes, whilst the results showed high sensitivity to increasing changes of bottom-up drivers that cascaded through the food-web from primary producers and detritus to pelagic and benthic consumers, respectively.

Changes in stratification could have important consequences in Cold Pool setup and degradation, processes fundamental to high fishery productivity of the region.

Yet their impact on the environment needs to be assessed. Here, we couple a hydrodynamic (including tides and waves) and sediment transport model with a description of the organic carbon and mineral particle dynamics in the water column and sediments. The model is applied to the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ) where OWFs currently occupy 7% of its surface area which is estimated to double in the next 5 years. The impact of OWFs on the environment is represented through the filtration of the water column and fecal pellets production by the blue mussel, the dominant fouling organism. Our model simulations show that the impact of biodeposition on the mud particle sedimentation and on sediment composition is small compared to the fluxes associated with tidal deposition and resuspension and the lateral inputs. In contrast, the total organic carbon (TOC) flux to the sediment is significantly altered inside the OWF perimeters and TOC deposition is increased up to 50% in an area 5 km around the monopiles. Further away, the TOC flux to the bottom decreases with a notable effect up to 30 km away. The major changes are found along the direction of the main residual current and tidal ellipse's major axis. In addition, sub-mesoscale gyres act as retention areas with increased carbon deposition. A future OWF in the BCZ will be located close to gravel beds in a Natura 2000 area, considered as vulnerable habitats and biodiversity hotspots. The different scenarios for this OWF, varying in turbine number and positioning, are compared in terms of impact on the carbon and mineral particle deposition flux in the BCZ and, particularly, to these gravel beds. The scenarios show that the number of turbines has only a slight impact on the TOC deposition flux, unlike their positioning that significantly alters the TOC flux to the gravel beds.

From the vantage point of the receptor species, we consider how their perception of EMF varies through time as a consequence of species' sensory biology, life history theory, and movement ecology. We review known effects of EMFs on species and consider EMF interactions with benthic, bentho-pelagic, and migratory species, focusing on functional roles of electro- and magneto-reception at different life stages.

The present knowledge base has been drawn from a diverse range of laboratory and field approaches, which can be better integrated to address gaps and reach the desired knowledge base. Improving models of future scenarios depends on taking a more systematic and consistent approach to measuring and modeling alternating current and direct current EMFs and accounting for cable properties and local environmental characteristics.

Iranian livestock sector faces a variety of the challenges such as high costs of energy and environmental legislations as well as an increasing demand for dairy products to respond the growing population. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on technical efficiency as a key indicator of energy use within dairy farming systems. A Window Data Envelopment Analysis (W-DEA) with energy use as inputs and milk production as output was modelled with data from 25 provinces during the last 22 years (1994-2016) in Iran. In addition, the Slack-Based Model (SBM) was used to compare the radial DEA model with non-radial SBM, both in a dynamic environment (window analysis). The average efficiency score of Iranian dairy farming production system was estimated at approximately 0.85. Through the years, three provinces including Zanjan, Ardabil and Hormozgan had the highest technical efficiencies. Window analysis represented that provinces are distinctive in terms of their technical efficiencies and energy consumption over the years. Applying the SBM model improved the accuracy of the estimated efficiency scores compared to the radial (DEA) model. Further analysis represented a significant difference between the technical efficiency of different milk production levels. Provinces that produced higher volumes of milk had lower technical efficiencies. Based on the results it can be concluded that there is a substantial space for upgrading the technical efficiency of dairy farming in Iran by improving resource use efficiency which leads to an optimized energy consumption. It is recommended to reform Iranian livestock farming policies by applying mechanized systems, optimal strategies for water, electricity and fossil fuel consumption, use of renewable energy and better feed management while enhancing milk productivity and technical efficiency. In this respect, it is suggested that policy makers consider different indicators such as energy use efficiency and environmental impacts when allocating subsidies and resources to different provinces and farms.

A variety of in situ and remote-sensing networks were used in concert with the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland (IBI) circulation forecast system, in order to investigate two persistent upwelling and downwelling events that occurred in the Northwestern (NW) Iberian coastal system during summer 2014. Special emphasis was placed on quality-controlled surface currents provided by a high-frequency radar (HFR), since this land-based technology can effectively monitor the upper layer flow over broad coastal areas in near-real time. The low-frequency spatiotemporal response of the ocean was explored in terms of wind-induced currents' structures and immediacy of reaction. Mean kinetic energy, divergence and vorticity maps were also calculated for upwelling and downwelling favorable events, in order to verify HFR and IBI capabilities, to accurately resolve the prevailing surface circulation features, such as the locus of a persistent upwelling maximum in the vicinity of Cape Finisterre. This integrated approach proved to be well-founded to efficiently portray the three-dimensional characteristics of the NW Iberian coastal upwelling system regardless of few shortcomings detected in IBI performance, such as the misrepresentation of the most energetic surface dynamics or the overestimation of the cooling and warming associated with upwelling and downwelling conditions, respectively. Finally, the variability of the NW Iberian upwelling system was characterized by means of the development of a novel ocean-based coastal upwelling index (UI), constructed from HFR-derived hourly surface current observations (UIHFR).

A maximum of 270W power output from the wind turbine was steadily recorded for this small-scale experimentally-oriented system recovering 13.5% of the energy used for ventilation.

Eddies were identified and tracked within a numerical simulation that used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model and an eddy characterization algorithm. Spatially, eddy births were more frequent: (1) nearshore (cyclones) and offshore (anticyclones) on the windward side of the main Hawai'ian Islands; (2) in patches of cyclones and anticyclones that resembled the dipole structure of wind stress curl along the islands' leeward side; and (3) in zonal patches of eddies of both polarities west and north of the islands. Temporally, high eddy activities occurred in spring. There was a meridional distribution of eddy lifespans, which increased northward. Cyclones were more abundant, longer-lived, smaller, and more nonlinear. Reef fish spawning locations in Hawai'i coincide with the regions of high eddy activity, with nonlinear eddies responsible for high larval retention.Plain Language Summary It has been well documented that rotating bodies of water-the so-called cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies-heavily influence biological productivity in the North Pacific. However, the dynamics of eddy formation and activity are not always clear, often lacking spatial resolution and statistical evaluation. Here we used a general circulation model and an eddy detection tool to provide a comprehensive description of ocean eddies in a 3,500 x 2,000 km region of the North Pacific. Our analysis revealed seasonality in eddy genesis for the whole region, with more eddies forming in spring. Eddy generation west of the Big Island of Hawai'i is consistent with the mechanism of formation by the strong dipole of wind stress curl. Notably, there are marked spatial patterns of eddy rotations, sizes, propagation speeds, and lifespans on both sides of the main Hawai'ian Islands. This work also sheds light on the linkages between eddy activity and retention of larval fish in the Hawai'ian Archipelago. Spawning sites of coral reef fish in Hawai'i coincide with most of the regions of high eddy activity. Interestingly, regardless of eddy polarity, nonlinear slow-propagating (fast swirling) eddies enhance larval retention while linear fast-propagating (slow-swirling) eddies enhance larval export and eventually larval dispersion.Key PointsEddy generation in the North Pacific is highest in spring and lowest in fall except for the regions alongside the main Hawaiian Islands Mean anticyclone eddy intensity is significantly weaker than cyclone eddy intensity Regardless of eddy polarity, nonlinear (linear) eddies enhance larval retention (export) in island population of coral reef fish",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Ruffino, L.; Thompson, D.; O'Brien, S.",Black-legged kittiwake population dynamics and drivers of population change in the context of offshore wind development.,JNCC Report,651,,i,"vii, 1-59",,May-20,2020,"This report presents a summary of existing evidence, and potential research opportunities, to better understand the population dynamics of black-legged kittiwakes and how populations might respond to potential additional mortality from offshore wind farm development. This work has been undertaken on behalf of the Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring and Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf). OWSMRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified a lack of understanding of cumulative impacts from offshore wind development on kittiwakes as one of the greatest environmental consenting risks. Improving confidence in models that assess population response to offshore wind farm mortality was identified as one of three key knowledge gaps in this area, the other two being: reducing uncertainty around estimates of collision mortality and connectivity between offshore wind farms and SPAs. JNCC organised a workshop that aimed to identify research opportunities that will improve understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and drivers of population change in the context of offshore wind development, thereby improving our ability to predict population response to novel impacts. During the workshop, experts were invited to suggest research that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics, under three high-level objectives: 1 Reduce uncertainty around current PVA (population viability analysis) modelling approaches through obtaining better evidence with which to parameterise PVA models; 2 Improve understanding of the wider context in which current typically colony-specific PVA approaches sit, e.g. the wider spatial scale at which population processes, such as meta-population dynamics and density dependence might be operating; 3 Identify drivers of change in kittiwake populations and their mechanism of operation to understand the relative impact of offshore wind development alongside other pressures, and options for managing pressures to inform discussions around I ROPI/derogation conservation measures. This report provides a summary of existing evidence, followed by research opportunities (RO) suggested by experts that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics in the context of offshore wind development. The research opportunities were: Research Opportunities leading to better parameterisation of current population modelling approaches and improved understanding of wider context of kittiwake population dynamics (Objectives 1 and 2 above): RO3.1 Use of large-scale strategic modelling approaches to better understand kittiwake meta-population dynamics and estimate connectivity among colonies. This project makes use of an existing meta-population modelling framework, which has been developed by the University of Glasgow, to estimate the strength of connectivity among kittiwake colonies in key areas of Britain and Ireland. The outputs of this model will also inform the optimisation of future monitoring and data collection of the most influential demographic parameters. This would provide a better understanding of the wider population context in which individual kittiwake SPA colony dynamics operate, e.g. is the Flamborough and Filey Coast SPA operating as a source or sink population and how does this change predictions of population response to additional mortality? RO3.2 Further development of a population modelling tool that assists with assessing population response to changes in mortality or productivity. This project will add additional functionality to an existing on-line PVA Tool, specifically a meta-population function that allows emigration and immigration to be incorporated into the population models. Movement rates will be informed by the outputs of RO3.1. This would improve confidence in predicted population response to estimated mortality from a planned offshore wind development by bringing more biological realism to current PVA approaches. It would also enable better modelling of other management measures that could increase productivity and survival, thereby informing evaluation of conservation measures. RO3.3 Strategic mark-recapture studies to improve empirical estimates of connectivity and survival. This project will assess the feasibility of a large-scale kittiwake mark-recapture study, such as colour-ringing, in the UK to improve empirical estimates of key demographic rates such as survival and dispersal rates. Better estimates of these parameters are needed to improve the parameterisation of PVA and meta-population models, e.g. RO3.1 and RO3.2, leading to improved confidence in predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm mortality. RO3.4 Reconstructing adult survival rates for populations where empirical estimates are lacking. This project addresses the lack of population-specific empirical estimates of kittiwake survival rates. It will make use of an existing modelling approach developed by the University of Glasgow to reconstruct survival estimates for kittiwake colonies of interest where this information is lacking. This information would enable better parameterisation of population models, as described in RO3.1 and RO3.2. RO3.5 Estimating the form and strength of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake population dynamics at different spatial scales. This project makes use of the rich kittiwake colony monitoring datasets available in the UK, as well as existing robust population modelling approaches, to try to detect patterns of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake colonies. The form and strength of density dependence used in PVA models strongly influences model predictions about how the population will respond to additional mortality. Obtaining and implementing novel empirical data on how density dependence operates on populations and the spatial and temporal scales over which density dependence might occur will improve confidence in PVA predictions. RO3.6 Detecting depensation effects by modelling kittiwake population dynamics. With this project, it is proposed to build a model to assess the relative importance of depensatory density dependence in breeding kittiwake populations, evaluate its strength and infer where and when this process may be more likely to occur. Identifying at what population size/density kittiwake populations are at risk of declining to extinction due to depensation effects is important as additional mortality on populations could inadvertently push populations into such a decline. RO3.7 Evaluating the proportion of UK kittiwake populations that are non-breeding adults. This RO is a desk-based study to estimate the extent of non-breeding in UK kittiwake populations using available data on population size, breeding success and adult survival. The results from this RO would help better estimate the proportion of non-breeders in kittiwake populations and anticipate their ability to buffer a population against declines (including steeper declines for already declining populations) in size due to reduced adult survival and/or productivity. This will bring more biological realism to current PVA models and improve confidence in predictions about how populations will respond to offshore wind mortality. Research Opportunities focussing on understanding potential kittiwake population response to changes in management of drivers of population change (Objective 3 above): RO3.8 Examining the ecosystem processes driving the relationship between kittiwake breeding success and sea surface temperature. This RO will improve understanding of how climate change is impacting kittiwake productivity and how other factors may be compounding the negative effects of warming seas. This RO will examine how various environmental and biological factors may have led to variation in breeding success between colonies and within colonies over time. Better understanding of what determines productivity at different colonies will improve predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to change in the future due to climate change, along with other drivers of change such as offshore wind development. It will also ensure that potential conservation measures account for environmental and biological drivers of population change, and that conservation measures are effective and achieve the desired outcomes. RO3.9 Kittiwake diets during the breeding season, and the relationship between prey availability and productivity. This project is a combination of desk-based and field studies to determine kittiwake dietary patterns during the breeding season and improve our understanding of the relationship between non-sandeel prey availability and productivity. This RO will help build confidence in how kittiwake populations are responding to declines in sandeel availability and thus assess their resilience to additional mortality, e.g. from offshore wind development. This would also provide key evidence to inform conservation measures, such as how kittiwake populations might respond to changes in management of commercial fisheries. RO3.10 Assessing the current and future condition of alternative fish prey populations: a desk-based study. With this RO, it is proposed to review the literature on forage fish species, specifically population status and trends, drivers of population dynamics, current fishing pressure and projected impacts of climate change on forage fish populations. This information will assist with identifying kittiwake colonies that are vulnerable to additional mortality and those that are likely to be more resilient to additional mortality, e.g. from OWF development, due to predicted availability of prey/forage fish species. Additionally, this will help assess which conservation management measures may be ineffective due to changes in forage fish populations. RO3.11 Quantifying the effects of fisheries management on kittiwake demography. This RO involves designing a monitoring plan that would maximise power to detect changes in demographic rates that could be attributed to changes in fisheries management. This would be followed by data collection prior to changes in fishing effort, which would provide a baseline against which to assess demographic response to management. This project will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of fishing-related conservation measures. RO3.12 Predicting the demographic consequences of various potential measures to manage pressures on kittiwake populations. This project would develop a strategic modelling framework that would enable identification of those pressures that exert the most detrimental effects on kittiwake demographic rates and then evaluate potential management options in terms of population rates of change. This information would bring wider context to current PVA assessments of population response to offshore wind mortality and inform likely efficacy of potential conservation measures. Specifically, this project would demonstrate the relative impact of offshore wind development on kittiwake populations, alongside other drivers of population change. Several of these research opportunities would complement each other, and combined, could greatly increase our understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and how populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm development and conservation management measures. This would lead to significant reductions in uncertainty in assessments of cumulative impacts on kittiwake from offshore wind farm developments.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Steckley, Joshua","Cash cropping worms: How the Lumbricus terrestris bait worm market operates in Ontario, Canada",GEODERMA,363,,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114128,Apr 1 2020,2020,"Anecic earthworms such as Lumbricus terrestris are ecosystem engineers whose impacts on soil fertility and remediation have been extensively researched. The majority of L. terrestris used for such research and practical remediation applications are procured through the largely unknown bait worm market that serves freshwater recreational fishermen across North America and Europe. Some earthworm researchers have questioned the use of these bait worms for research and soil inoculations because of their untraceable origins, unknown environmental exposures and growing conditions, as well as the sustainability of harvesting practices. However, there has been no recent study of this unique industry and how it hand-picks hundreds of millions of L. terrestris worms annually from a single region in southwestern Ontario. This paper provides a detailed description of how land and labour are currently organized to supply the world market for the valuable L. terrestris, commonly known as the Canadian Nightcrawler bait worm. Based on 59 semi-structured depth interviews, the findings show there are an estimated 500 to 700 million worms picked annually from farmer fields that stretch between Toronto and Windsor, Ontario. Dairy farms in particular have emerged as de facto L terrestris production sites because of their perennial alfalfa crops, heavy manure application, and reduced tillage practices. This has made L. terrestris the most lucrative crop in the region with many farmers leasing land to worm-picking operations for over $1000 CND per year ($750 USD/(sic)685) - approximately four times the regional rental rates. Worm-pickers have historically been recent immigrants to Ontario with the majority of current pickers coming from Vietnam. Worm pickers make $20CND ($15 USD, (sic)13.50) per thousand worms, and can pick over 20,000 worms per night in optimal field conditions (moisture, temperature, wind, moonlight). The piece-rate wages tend to reward speed and efficacy with some pickers capable of making over $600 in a single night. This peculiar arrangement between dairy farmers, soils, and worm pickers opens avenues for socio-economical, agronomical and ecological studies of commercial L. terrestris harvesting.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Jung, Dae-Hyun; Kim, Hak-Jin; Kim, Joon Yong; Lee, Taek Sung; Park, Soo Hyun",Model Predictive Control via Output Feedback Neural Network for Improved Multi-Window Greenhouse Ventilation Control,SENSORS,20,6,,,10.3390/s20061756,Mar-20,2020,"Maintaining environmental conditions for proper plant growth in greenhouses requires managing a variety of factors; ventilation is particularly important because inside temperatures can rise rapidly in warm climates.

In this study, a new ventilation control logic using an output feedback neural-network (OFNN) prediction and optimization method was developed, and this approach was tested in multi-window greenhouses used for strawberry production. The developed prediction model used 15 inputs and achieved a highly accurate performance (R-2 of 0.94). In addition, the method using an algorithm based on an OFNN was proposed for optimizing considered six window-opening behavior. Three case studies confirmed the optimization performance of OFNN in the nonlinear model and verified the performance through simulations.

The average seasonal IP values from the highest to the lowest were summer (664 +/- 270 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), autumn (350 +/- 118 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), spring (202 +/- 110 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and winter (137 +/- 68 mgC m(-2) day(-1)). The lowest IP was during the nutrient-rich winter because it had a short insolation duration, low incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and low light transmission (shallow euphotic zone depth) due to strong vertical mixing. In contrast to the winter, the highest IP was during the nutrient-depleted summer, which had a long insolation duration, high incident PAR and high light transmission (deeper euphotic zone depth). In addition, the heterotrophic nutrients from upwelling in the south might also support the highest IP in summer. As three primary water masses exist in the Taiwan Strait and three of them have different characteristics, different mixing ratios of water masses may cause different chemical and hydrographic conditions, which leads to different levels of Chl a concentrations and primary production.

Of the various senses, hearing plays a particularly important role for fishes in providing information, often from great distances, from all around these animals. This information is in all three spatial dimensions, often overcoming the limitations of other senses such as vision, touch, taste and smell. Sound is used for communication between fishes, mating behaviour, the detection of prey and predators, orientation and migration and habitat selection. Thus, anything that interferes with the ability of a fish to detect and respond to biologically relevant sounds can decrease survival and fitness of individuals and populations. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, there has been a growing increase in the noise that humans put into the water. These anthropogenic sounds are from a wide range of sources that include shipping, sonars, construction activities (e.g., wind farms, harbours), trawling, dredging and exploration for oil and gas. Anthropogenic sounds may be sufficiently intense to result in death or mortal injury. However, anthropogenic sounds at lower levels may result in temporary hearing impairment, physiological changes including stress effects, changes in behaviour or the masking of biologically important sounds. The intent of this paper is to review the potential effects of anthropogenic sounds upon fishes, the potential consequences for populations and ecosystems and the need to develop sound exposure criteria and relevant regulations. However, assuming that many readers may not have a background in fish bioacoustics, the paper first provides information on underwater acoustics, with a focus on introducing the very important concept of particle motion, the primary acoustic stimulus for all fishes, including elasmobranchs. The paper then provides background material on fish hearing, sound production and acoustic behaviour. This is followed by an overview of what is known about effects of anthropogenic sounds on fishes and considers the current guidelines and criteria being used world-wide to assess potential effects on fishes. Most importantly, the paper provides the most complete summary of the effects of anthropogenic noise on fishes to date. It is also made clear that there are currently so many information gaps that it is almost impossible to reach clear conclusions on the nature and levels of anthropogenic sounds that have potential to cause changes in animal behaviour, or even result in physical harm. Further research is required on the responses of a range of fish species to different sound sources, under different conditions.

Neither MF nor EMF had significant effect on embryonic or larval mortality, hatching time, larval growth, or the time of larvae swim-up from the bottom. However, both MF and EMF enhanced the yolk-sac absorption rate. Although it was not related directly to magnetic field effect, it was also shown that larvae with absorbed yolk-sacs by the time of swim-up were less efficient in taking advantage of available food at first feeding (i.e., obtained smaller weight at age).

The increased primary production and detritus resulted in the increased food supply for zooplankton, which made it possible for planktivorous species (particularly anchovies) to be fed. Consequently, the biomass and production of some benthic fish increased, which indicates a potential reef effect. Other groups with decreased biomasses and productions may have been negatively impacted by the OWFs.

A significant effect of a magnetic field, however, was observed on the time of hatching (one day earlier in a magnetic field than in a control), yolk-sac size on 1 DPH (smaller in a magnetic field), and yolk-sac absorption time (faster in a magnetic field). Faster yolk-sac absorption time in a magnetic field was interpreted as an indication of increased metabolic rate.

The present study proposes site selection framework for provisional zebra mussel farming in a eutrophic lagoon ecosystem, aimed primarily at remediation purposes. GIS-based multi-criteria approach was applied, combining data from empirical maps, numerical models and remote sensing to estimate suitability parameters. Site selection and prioritisation of suitable areas considered 15 environmental and socio-economic criteria, which contributed to 4 optimisation models (settlement, growth and survival of mussels, environmental and socio-economic) and 3 predefined scenarios representing provisional goals of mussel cultivation: spat production, biomass production and bioremediation. The relative importance of each criterion was assessed utilizing the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Site suitability index was calculated and the final result of the site selection analysis was summarized for 3 scenarios and overall suitability map. Four suitability classes (unsuitable, least, moderately and most suitable) were applied, and 3 most suitable zones for provisional zebra mussel cultivation with 12 candidate sites were selected accordingly. The integrated approach presented in this study can be adjusted for designating zebra mussel farming sites in other estuarine lagoon ecosystems, or cultivation of other mussel species for bioremediation purposes.

Further evaluation of the scenarios indicates that the level of exergy match may reach 0.87 while primary energy and primary exergy savings over separate energy production from renewables may be 38% and 61%, respectively. The solution areas can address aspects of an energy, water, and food nexus based on energy from waste, energy for irrigation and agriculture, and other linkages.

These focus on sea mammals, seabirds, benthos or demersal fish, but generally ignore any potential effects OWFs may have on the pelagic ecosystem. The only work on the latter has been through modelling analyses, which predict localised impacts like enhanced vertical mixing leading to a decrease in seasonal stratification, as well as shelf-wide changes of tidal amplitudes. Here we provide for the first-time empirical bio-physical data from an OWF. The data were obtained by towing a remotely operated vehicle (TRIAXUS ROW) through two non-operating OWFs in the summer stratified North Sea. The undulating TRIAXUS transects provided high-resolution CTD data accompanied by oxygen and chlorophyll-a measurements. We provide empirical indication that vertical mixing is increased within the OWFs, leading to a doming of the thermocline and a subsequent transport of nutrients into the surface mixed layer (SML). Nutrients were taken up rapidly because underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) enabled net primary production in the entire water column, especially within submesoscale chlorophyll-a pillars that were observed at regular intervals within the OWF regions. Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) images revealed distinct meroplankton distribution patterns in a copepod-dominated plankton community. Hydroacoustic records did not show any OWF effects on the distribution of pelagic fish. The results of a pre-OWF survey show however, that it is difficult to fully separate the anthropogenic impacts from the natural variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

MRED -benthic interactions may cause changes that are of a sufficient scale to change ecosystem services provision, particularly in terms of fisheries and biodiversity and, via trophic linkages, change the distribution of fish, birds and mammals. The production of DRIPy data should be eliminated and the resources used instead to address relevant questions that are logically bounded in time and space. Efforts should target identifying metrics of change that can be linked to ecosystem function or service provision, particularly where those metrics show strongly non-linear effects in relation to the stressor.

Besides their high fossil fuel expenditures, hospital buildings generate large amounts of plumbing wastes and others, such that they are the largest producer of GHG emissions in the building sector. Energy costs are consuming up to 15% of their annual profits. In this paper the overall environmental and economic problems that may be associated especially with large healthcare facilities are addressed by showing ways to convert their energy and environmental disadvantages into advantages. In this respect, a concept study with ecological sanitation and formation of an energy, water, food, and education nexus by primarily employing a trigeneration system operating with biogas at an optimum fuel share with natural gas for retrofitting an existing 900-bed University hospital is presented. This case study covers two scenarios. The first scenario is the base scenario, which utilizes three trigeneration engines, with one 1,25 MWe, and two 2,2 MWe capacity each, all running on natural gas with a total capacity of 5,65 MWe. The second scenario includes three stages. The first stage mixes natural gas with biogas, which is to be produced on-site by primarily using plumbing wastes, for driving the 1,25 MWe engine, which satisfies the constant base load of the hospital for 24h a day. The second stage produces biogas by making use of the widely available surrounding free land of the hospital in a new eco-farm development and replaces the fuel input of the first 2,2 MWe engine, which operates 16 h a day on average. In the third stage the second trigeneration unit with 2,2 MWe capacity remains on natural gas fuel input and operates approximately 8 h a day (peaking engine). Both scenarios have an absorption cooling system with the same capacity and an 8 MWc-h ice tank. This common base of identical power, heat, and cold capacities was aimed to independently focus on the environmental and economic benefits of biogas substitution covering a ten-year operational period. The next system for stage two involves a new organic 6000 livestock-animal organic farm and a dairy factory to be owned by the University, which completes the food, water, energy, education and environment nexus and serves as a full-scale hands-on farm for the Department of Agriculture students and provide an R&D platform. It has been shown that such an application closes the loop towards sustain ability. The organic venture is expected to have a large economic impact and important contributions also on the dietary needs of the patients. The organic farm is envisioned to incorporate greenhouses, wind, and solar farms. Yet this study only covers the impact of the biogas supply to the trigeneration system: CO2 emissions from biogas generation is assumed to be captured and utilized for dry ice production. Analyses show that the additional cost of on-site biogas anaerobic digester and its ancillaries of the. first-stage (1,25 MWe) may pay back themselves in four years. The corresponding prediction for the second stage biogas trigeneration system with biogas fuel (2,2 MWe) is also four years.Total reduction in CO2 emissions attributable to the biogas conversion of the trigeneration system is 161558,2 t CO2 over a ten-year period, taking into account the additional reductions due to improvements in rational exergy management of the energy resources. The net total savings from biogas conversion in two stages is expected to be about 4 M(sic) for a ten-year period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for mussel culture. Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e.g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining mussel culture in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored.

Focusing on behavioural and physiological aspects of migration can help to provide better understanding, management and conservation of migratory populations. Here, we highlight different physiological, behavioural and biomechanical aspects of animal migration that will help us to understand how migratory animals interact with current and future anthropogenic threats. We are in the early stages of a changing planet, and our understanding of how physiology is linked to the persistence of migratory animals is still developing; therefore, we regard the following questions as being central to the conservation physiology of animal migrations. Will climate change influence the energetic costs of migration? Will shifting temperatures change the annual clocks of migrating animals? Will anthropogenic influences have an effect on orientation during migration? Will increased anthropogenic alteration of migration stopover sites/migration corridors affect the stress physiology of migrating animals? Can physiological knowledge be used to identify strategies for facilitating the movement of animals? Our synthesis reveals that given the inherent challenges of migration, additional stressors derived from altered environments (e.g. climate change, physical habitat alteration, light pollution) or interaction with human infrastructure (e.g. wind or hydrokinetic turbines, dams) or activities (e.g. fisheries) could lead to long-term changes to migratory phenotypes.

The results show that the system with solar PV has higher reliability compared to the one with wind turbine at equal life cycle cost. The reliability of the system with solar PV and solar PV with battery varies significantly with the life cycle cost at low cost range then becomes stable. On the other hand, it was found to be quite stable in the cases of wind turbine with and without battery. Adding battery to the system significantly increases the reliability of solar PV and slightly increases for wind turbine. At the life cycle cost lower than $1 million, maximum reliability of the system with solar PV is around 53%. By adding battery, the reliability of the system can be up to 90%.

However, the energy needs of the agricultural area are to be met using the non absorbed wind power. The study is a qualitative approach and examines ways for the load shed of a wind farm to be used for agricultural purposes and meet the demand and at the same time offer to the grid a less fluctuating electricity production signal.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found.

Korea will mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions by 25.7% compared to BAU 2030, and will reduce its emissions by a further 11.3% by purchasing external certified emission reductions.But renewable energy production in Korea accounts for only about an insufficient 3% of the total energy production. Moreover, wind power accounts for a meager 2.2% of that ratio as well.For this reason, the current policy for supplying energy through wind power can be deemed to be lacking. The two policies of FIT(feed-in-tariff) and RPS(renewable portfolio standard) need to be appropriately “mixed”: RPS as it is currently stipulated in the “Act on the Promotion of the Development, Use and Diffusion of New and Renewable Energy” should be applied to large-scale projects, while FIT should be available to residents to encourage their participation.For the facilitation of wind power, this article suggests four improvements to be conducted: First, it is necessary to provide certification processes for wind power plants and technology development.Second, it is necessary to evolve from a government-led renewable energy policy system to one that allows the cooperation of local governments and citizens. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a sustainable energy supply system centered around the local governments that is suitable for the development, supply and consumption of renewable energy according to the needs of the local community.Third, measures to increase the people's acceptance of renewable energy are needed to be put into place.

Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation.

Research has left the question largely unanswered of how agricultural biogas production and use are - and can best be - organized within rural society.

The European Union has launched an ambitious program to increase the contribution of energy production from wind turbines; the aim set for the year 2020 is that wind power should account for 31% of EU's current target regarding 20% reductions of carbon dioxide. This policy is favored by the fact that wind energy production cost is nowadays competitive in many cases to the cost of electricity produced from conventional non-renewable sources. However, there is a conflict concerning public attitudes: although the public in general is in favor of renewable energy sources including wind, there is usually very strong opposition by local people living in neighboring areas of wind farm developments that is attitudes toward wind power are to a large extent different from attitudes toward wind farms. It is also interesting that negative public opinion is rather high during the planning stage and significantly lower during the implementation stage. In addition, there are impacts on landscape aesthetic, human health as well as ecological impact on the flora and fauna, although compared to environmental impact from conventional energy sources, the environmental impact caused by wind turbines is relatively minor. Recent developments of offshore wind farms seemed to avoid people's negative attitudes and soften public resistance and hostility against wind power energy but these expectations were rather optimistic. Opposition due to seascape aesthetic spoiling is as strong even for the marine environment. The impact on marine life and particularly on sea mammals due to noise and vibrations need to be further investigated. Existing activities such as navigation, fishing and recreational activities should not be hindered during site selection and planning.

Contemporary transmission relies largely on above-ground electric transmission structures and lines. The construction, operation, and maintenance of tall structures, such as power lines, communication towers, wind turbines, and other installations and their associated activities in sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) habitats were identified as a conservation threat by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in its decision to designate greater sage-grouse (C. urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse) as a candidate species for protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Greater Sage-grouse Range-wide Comprehensive Strategy identified a need to synthesize the research on the effects of tall structures on sage-grouse as the first step in a process to develop best management practices (BMPs) to minimize potential negative impacts on the species. The Utah Wildlife-in-Need Foundation (UWIN) facilitated a public input process in 2010 to assess stakeholder contemporary knowledge regarding the effects of tall structures on sage-grouse. Stakeholders reviewed published information to evaluate the scientific basis for the potential impacts of tall structures on sage-grouse. At the time of the UWIN review, stakeholders concluded that there were no peer-reviewed, experimental studies reported in the scientific literature that specifically documented increased avoidance or predation on sage-grouse because of the construction, operation, and maintenance of tall structures. Consequently, stakeholders were concerned that the science upon which tall structure siting decisions are based was lacking, and as a result, temporal and spatial setbacks and buffers stipulations may differ by governmental agency. Stakeholders recommended that research implemented to address their concerns include experimental designs that simultaneously address multiple knowledge gaps, include metrics assessing potential individual and cumulative impacts of each tall structure type, and a collaborative process that allows preliminary results to be implemented in an adaptive management approach to actively refine BMPs. Lastly, stakeholders recommended that industry be provided mitigation incentives as part of a comprehensive strategy to fund desired research.

One method for identifying the impacts of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on human welfare is through the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Using an ecosystem services approach, this paper reviews the impacts of OWFs on the ecosystem services delivered by marine environments. During the construction phase, supporting services such as reduced energy capture and nutrient cycling are changed due to the introduction of hard substrate and the reduction in soft sediment habitat at turbine bases. This may lead to changes in all other ecosystem services, both negative and positive. Quantifying these changes, however, is a challenge partly due to data limitations and a lack of clear understanding of the impacts of OWFs on the marine ecosystems. Scientific effort needs to quantitatively explore the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem functionality and the gathering of data that enables the assessment of changes to ecosystem services. Data needed to better quantify and value the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem services are suggested.

It requires higher economic performance of the wind farm than the original fishing activity in the same sea surface area.The proposed concept is the combination of a floating wind turbine and counter-rotating water current turbine. The water current turbine partially cancels the reaction torque of electric generator and provides additional energy production from water current.

Due to stakeholder conflicts and a lack of spat availability, mussel farmers tend to move offshore where space is not limited and adequate settlement guaranteed. Newcomers - the offshore wind farmers - are covering large areas in the German Bight which in contrast give the opportunity to use these areas in a multifunctional way by accepting mussel cultivation within the wind farms. This study compiles the basic data for offshore mussel cultivation in close vicinity to a designated offshore wind farm in the open sea of the German Bight and employs different case-scenario calculations to illustrate the impact of changing parameter values on overall profitability or non-profitability of this activity. Primary focus is placed on the production of consumer mussels but seed mussel cultivation is also taken into consideration. We show that production of consumer mussels with longline technology is sufficiently profitable even under the assumption of substantial cost increases. This is especially true, if existing capacities could be used. The cultivation of seed mussels depends on the possibility of using existing equipment. A substantial increase of seed mussel prices to at least 0.6, given the main cost categories remaining constant, turns this alternative into substantial profitability. This study concludes with providing some recommendations on how favorable terms or actions could further improve profitability of offshore mussel cultivation.

The first level (Tier #1) screening determines the potential energy resource to be exploited and then identifies areas that are prohibited from siting because there is a direct, irreconcilable conflict, as determined by a stakeholder process and vetted by regulators. Areas that remain after these exclusions are implemented are candidates for facility siting. The next step involves considering technical (engineering and economic) attributes of the proposed energy development that further restricts the area under consideration. Finally, Tier #2 screening (not addressed here) evaluates other use conflicts such as recreational and commercial fishing areas, marine mammal feeding and breeding grounds and transit paths, bird migratory paths, feeding, and nesting areas, and similar issues that must be considered in facility siting.To facilitate the application of technology constraints on siting, two methods are proposed, a Technology Development Index (TDI) and a Principal Components - Cluster Analysis (PCCA). The TDI method, developed by the authors and presented in this paper, is the ratio of the Technical Challenge Index (ICI) to the Power Production Potential (PPP) of the energy extraction device. TCI is a measure of how difficult it is to site the device at a given location plus a measure of the distance to the closest electrical grid connection point. The PPP is an estimate of the annual power production of one of the devices. The site with the lowest TDI represents the optimum location. In practice, the study area is gridded and the TDI (TCI and PPP) is calculated for each grid. The method explicitly accounts for the spatial variability of all input data. Simulations can be performed either deterministically or stochastically, using a Monte Carlo method, so that uncertainties in the underlying input data are reflected in the estimated values of the TDI. The later approach allows detailed assessment of the sensitivity of the estimates to the input data and formulations of the ICI and PPP. The results are presented in the form of contours of TDI. The method can be applied to any offshore renewable energy type or extraction system once the technical attributes are specified.The PCCA approach uses several spatially varying variables that describe the key attributes of the siting decision (e.g., water depth, power production potential, distance to shore, and seabed conditions). The principal components are first determined from the gridded data and then clusters are identified. Finally, the clusters are mapped to the study area. The attributes and spatial distribution of clusters provide insight into the optimum locations for development.The two methods were employed in identifying potential areas for siting of a wind farm in coastal waters of Rhode Island, assuming lattice jacket support structures for the wind turbines.

The Finnish power industry has made plans for building around 6,000 MW of offshore wind power in coastal areas, mainly targeting areas with a water depth of less than 20 metres. The reali- sation of these plans will mean that at least 1,500 units will be established along the coast in several wind parks. Information on the effects of wind power on fauna in the Baltic Sea is sparse. Wind power is relatively new in other sea areas, too, and experience of its effect on fish, birds and mam- mals limited to a short period. The effect of a single tower may prove easier to predict, but assessment of one or more large wind parks along a length of coast presents greater difficulty. Building wind power in a sea area causes several changes in the environment, some of which carry long-term effects. Dredging during building causes deterioration of water qual- ity and increasing sedimentation in the surroundings. Construction noise may reach levels that can harm living creatures in the immediate vicinity. Noise may also travel far in the water column, during the operational as well as the construction phase.

In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen.Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration.One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratingueta, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses. As conclusion, this paper shows the economical analysis comparing buses moved by fuel cells using hydrogen by different kinds of production.

For decades Channel Island archaeologists have studied Middle Holocene shell middens visually dominated by large and often whole shells of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Here we use modern ecological data, historical accounts, commercial red abalone catch records, and zooarchaeological data to examine long-term spatial and temporal variation in the productivity of red abalone fisheries on the Northern Channel Islands, California (USA). Historical patterns of abundance, in which red abalone densities increase from east to west through the islands, extend deep into the Holocene. The correlation of historical and archaeological data argue for long-term spatial continuity in productive red abalone fisheries and a resilience of abalone populations despite dramatic ecological changes and intensive human predation spanning more than 8000 years. Archaeological, historical, and ecological data suggest that California kelp forests and red abalone populations are structured by a complex combination of top-down and bottom-up controls.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Snyder, Brian; Kaiser, Mark J.",Ecological and economic cost-benefit analysis of offshore wind energy,RENEWABLE ENERGY,34,6,1567,1578,10.1016/j.renene.2008.11.015,Jun-09,2009,"Wind energy has experienced dramatic growth over the past decade. A small fraction of this growth has occurred offshore. but as the best wind resources become developed onshore, there is increasing interest in the development of offshore winds. Like any form of power production, offshore wind energy has both positive and negative impacts. The potential negative impacts have stimulated a great deal of opposition to the first offshore wind power proposals in the U.S. and have delayed the development of the first offshore wind farm in the U.S. Here we discuss the costs and benefits of offshore wind relative to onshore wind power and conventional electricity production. We review cost estimates for offshore wind power and compare these to estimates for onshore wind and conventional power. We develop empirical cost functions for offshore wind based on publicly reported projects from 2000 to 2008, and describe the limitations of the analysis. We use this analysis to inform a discussion of the tradeoffs between conventional, onshore and offshore wind energy usage. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces a model simulating odour dispersion downwind from natural windbreaks. The standard k-epsilon model of the FLUENT software was used to incorporate the effect of climatic conditions and windbreak structure. The model was calibrated for wind velocity recovery, odour concentration (OC) from field observations and inertial resistance. Once calibrated, the model accurately reproduced the odour plume developing downwind from the windbreak. The correlation between OC for 11 field trials and that simulated were statistically significant (P < 0.01), indicating that the model was accurate. The model demonstrated that a windbreak did alter the magnitude and direction of the wind velocity, thus creating a pressure jump across its width. This pressure jump produces a strong downwind turbulence forming a mixing layer capable of enhancing odour dispersion.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Otero, Jaime; Alvarez-Salgado, Xose Anton; Gonzalez, Angel F.; Miranda, Ana; Groom, Steve B.; Cabanas, Jose M.; Casas, Gerardo; Wheatley, Ben; Guerra, Angel","Bottom-up control of common octopus Octopus vulgaris in the Galician upwelling system, northeast Atlantic Ocean",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,362,,181,192,10.3354/meps07437,2008,2008,"This paper investigates the possible underlying causes of the wide interannual fluctuations in catch of the common octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797 in one of the main small-scale fisheries off the coast of Galicia (northwest Spain). Galicia is at the northern boundary of the Iberian-Canary current upwelling system in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, where local winds induce seasonal upwelling, largely driving the annual cycles of primary and secondary production. We hypothesize that such dynamics are also fundamental for the survival of the planktonic stages of octopus and set the year class strength. We address this hypothesis by investigating the influence of upwelling on time-series of octopus fishery data. Wind stress structure during the spring-summer (prior to the hatching peak) and autumn-winter (during the planktonic stage) was found to affect the early life phase of this species, and explains up to 85% of the total variance of the year-to-year variability of the adult catch.

It also reveals how, during the processes of renewal, Muros has become more deeply dependent on its fishery due to an inability amongst the actors of the production system to leave the evolutionary paths laid down by earlier investment in the fishing industries.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"Furness, Bob","Seabird breeding failures, climate change and wind farms.",Scottish Bird News,74,,18,19,,Dec-04,2004,,cannot access,Ray,,,,,,,,,C,"Mosher, J; Higgins, KF; Osborn, RG; Naugle, DE; Bakker, KK",Session three.

Within these large systems, upwelling rate, primary production and fish production are all positively correlated, as would be expected on trophodynamic grounds. Existing measurements suggest that the Benguela and the Peru Current systems are 2-4 times more productive than the California Current in terms of primary production and support 2-10 times more fish per square kilometre. The Benguela and Peru Current systems are 2-3 times more efficient in production of fish and harvestable yield to man as the California Current. The California Current appears to be less efficient primarily because a greater fraction of the annual primary production is transported offshore from the major upwelling sites by the prevailing winds and meandering structure of the currents. The strong seasonal variability in upwelling off California probably also results in poor trophodynamic coupling between the herbivores and phytoplankton. Consequently, less of the phytoplankton is consumed and, potentially. more can be exported out of the system. Hake (Merluccius spp.) are opportunistic, apex predators of euphausiids and pelagic and demersal fish in the three upwelling systems. The striking dominance of euphausiids in the diet of hake in the California Current probably reflects the lesser abundance of demersal fish in that highly advective region.",No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,J,"VOITURIEZ, B; HERBLAND, A; LEBORGNE, R",EQUATORIAL UPWELLING IN THE EASTERN ATLANTIC DURING FGGE,OCEANOLOGICA ACTA,5,3,301,314,,1982,1982,,No,Ray,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,
