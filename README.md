For the offshore wind team Ghoti article and lit review.

On February 2, 2024, we used the following search string in a topic search ('All Databases') in Web of Science (subscription provided by the University of California) to obtain records related to artificial structures in marine environments that mentioned fish and production:

TS=(ship-wreck OR shipwreck OR (sunken NEAR/2 ship) OR ((oil OR gas OR petrol*) NEAR/5 (platform OR rig OR structure OR infrastructure)) OR (rig NEAR/2 reef) OR (wind* NEAR/2 (farm OR turbine OR structure)) OR manmade structure OR man-made structure OR (artificial NEAR/2 (reef OR structure))) AND TS=(producti*) AND TS=(fish*) NOT TS = (lake OR river OR pond)

We explicitly filtered to exclude patents and document types other than articles, dissertation theses, review articles, and “other”. We did an initial screening and further excluded records based on the following criteria: 1) record did not collect biological data related to marine artificial structures, 2) record did not present new empirical data (e.g., meta-analyses, reviews), 3) record could not be obtained in English, or 4) full text of record could not be obtained. 

From our screening, we found 276 scientific records related to fish production around artificial structures in marine environments. The first record was published in 1970, and the number of records has generally increased over time.

Then we further screened the full texts of these records to determine those studies that determined primary or secondary production empirically or using simulation modeling methods.

Of the 276 records, only 18 of them empirically determined primary (5) or secondary production (13), while 9 used simulation modeling to determine primary (9) or secondary (9) production. Thus, overall, only 9.78% of records quantified actual production estimates as fluxes of biomass.
